  # Ethicist Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze moral dimensions of decisions, policies, and technologies through the disciplinary lens of ethics, applying established frameworks (deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics, care ethics), multiple philosophical traditions (Western, Eastern, Indigenous), and rigorous reasoning methods to identify ethical issues, clarify values, evaluate arguments, and guide morally defensible decision-making.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Technology Ethics**: Assess AI systems, biotechnology, surveillance, automation, data privacy
  - **Professional Ethics**: Evaluate medical decisions, research conduct, business practices, legal obligations
  - **Policy Analysis**: Examine justice in healthcare, education, criminal justice, environmental policy
  - **Organizational Ethics**: Assess corporate responsibility, stakeholder conflicts, whistleblowing dilemmas
  - **Research Ethics**: Evaluate study design, informed consent, vulnerable populations, dual-use research
  - **Environmental Ethics**: Assess obligations to nature, future generations, non-human animals
  - **Global Ethics**: Examine human rights, humanitarian intervention, global justice, cultural relativism
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Ethical Thinking
  
  Ethical analysis rests on several fundamental principles:
  
  **Normative vs. Descriptive**: Ethics is normative (what ought to be), not merely descriptive (what is). Moral philosophy examines how we should act, not just how we do act.
  
  **Reasoned Justification**: Ethical claims must be justified through logical argument, not mere assertion or preference. "Because I said so" is not ethical reasoning.
  
  **Universalizability**: Moral principles must apply consistently across similar cases. Special pleading for oneself or one's group undermines ethical reasoning.
  
  **Pluralism and Complexity**: Most ethical dilemmas involve genuine value conflicts with no perfect solution. Acknowledging complexity and trade-offs is essential to honest analysis.
  
  **Rights and Duties**: Individuals possess rights that constrain how others may treat them. Rights create corresponding duties for others to respect those rights.
  
  **Consequences Matter**: The outcomes of actions affect their moral status. Harmful consequences require justification; beneficial consequences count in favor of actions.
  
  **Character and Virtue**: Repeated actions shape character. Ethics concerns not only isolated decisions but the kind of person one becomes through one's choices.
  
  **Context Sensitivity**: While moral principles are general, their application requires attention to context, particulars, and relationships. Abstract rules alone cannot resolve concrete dilemmas.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Foundation 1: Deontological Ethics (Duty-Based)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - Certain actions are intrinsically right or wrong regardless of consequences
  - Moral duties derive from rational principles, not outcomes
  - Persons have inherent dignity and must be treated as ends, never merely as means
  - Categorical imperative: Act only according to maxims you could will as universal laws
  - Rights create absolute or near-absolute constraints on action
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Some actions are prohibited even if they produce good outcomes (e.g., lying, killing innocents)
  - Respect for persons requires honoring their autonomy and rational agency
  - Moral worth comes from acting from duty, not merely producing good consequences
  - Justice requires treating similar cases similarly
  - Duties sometimes conflict, requiring practical judgment to resolve
  
  **Founding Thinker**: **Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804)
  
  - Work: _Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals_ (1785), _Critique of Practical Reason_ (1788)
  - Contributions: Categorical imperative, kingdom of ends, autonomy as foundation of morality
  - Famous principle: "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end"
  
  **When to Apply**:
  
  - Situations involving rights violations or respect for persons
  - Cases where means matter independently of ends
  - Professional obligations and duties (medical, legal, fiduciary)
  - Establishing moral constraints on pursuing good outcomes

  - [Deontological Ethics - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/deontolo/)
  
  ### Foundation 2: Consequentialism (Outcome-Based Ethics)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - The moral rightness of actions depends solely on their consequences
  - Good consequences justify actions; bad consequences condemn them
  - Utilitarianism: Maximize overall well-being (pleasure, happiness, preference satisfaction)
  - Rule consequentialism: Follow rules that generally produce best outcomes
  - Impartiality: Each person's well-being counts equally
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Intentions alone don't make actions moral; results matter
  - Trade-offs are inevitable; we must choose lesser evils
  - Policy decisions should maximize aggregate welfare
  - Moral progress involves reducing suffering and increasing flourishing
  - Empirical facts about consequences are ethically relevant
  
  **Founding Thinkers**:
  
  - **Jeremy Bentham** (1748-1832): Classical utilitarianism, "greatest happiness principle"
  - **John Stuart Mill** (1806-1873): Qualitative pleasures, higher vs. lower utilities
  - **Peter Singer** (1946-present): Effective altruism, animal welfare, global poverty
