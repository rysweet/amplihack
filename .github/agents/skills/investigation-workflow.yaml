  # Investigation Workflow Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  This skill provides a systematic 6-phase workflow for investigating and understanding existing systems, codebases, and architectures. Unlike development workflows optimized for implementation, this workflow is optimized for exploration, understanding, and knowledge capture.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  **Investigation Tasks** (use this workflow):
  
  - "Investigate how the authentication system works"
  - "Explain the neo4j memory integration"
  - "Understand why CI is failing consistently"
  - "Analyze the reflection system architecture"
  - "Research what hooks are triggered during session start"
  
  **Development Tasks** (use DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md instead):
  
  - "Implement OAuth support"
  - "Build a new API endpoint"
  - "Add feature X"
  - "Fix bug Y"
  
  ## Core Philosophy
  
  **Exploration First**: Define scope and strategy before diving into code
  **Parallel Deep Dives**: Deploy multiple agents simultaneously for efficient information gathering
  **Verification Required**: Test understanding through practical application
  **Knowledge Capture**: Document findings to prevent repeat investigations
  
  ## The 6-Phase Investigation Workflow
  
  ### Phase 1: Scope Definition
  
  **Purpose**: Define investigation boundaries and success criteria before any exploration.
  
  **Tasks**:
  
  - **FIRST**: Identify explicit user requirements - What specific questions must be answered?
  - **Use** prompt-writer agent to clarify investigation scope
  - **Use** ambiguity agent if questions are unclear
  - Define what counts as "understanding achieved"
  - List specific questions that must be answered
  - Set boundaries: What's in scope vs. out of scope
  - Estimate investigation depth needed (surface-level vs. deep dive)
  
  **Success Criteria**:
  
  - Clear list of questions to answer
  - Defined scope boundaries
  - Measurable success criteria (e.g., "can explain system flow", "can diagram architecture")
  
  **Deliverables**:
  
  - Investigation scope document with:
    - Core questions to answer
    - Success criteria
    - Scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)
    - Estimated depth and timeline
  
  ### Phase 2: Exploration Strategy
  
  **Purpose**: Plan which agents to deploy and what to investigate, preventing inefficient random exploration.
  
  **Tasks**:
  
  - **Use** architect agent to design exploration strategy
  - **Use** patterns agent to check for similar past investigations
  - Identify key areas to explore (code paths, configurations, documentation)
  - Select specialized agents for parallel deployment in Phase 3
  - Create investigation roadmap with priorities
  - Identify potential dead ends to avoid
  - Plan verification approach (how to test understanding)
  
  **Agent Selection Guidelines**:
  
  - **For code understanding**: analyzer, patterns agents
  - **For system architecture**: architect, api-designer agents
  - **For performance issues**: optimizer, analyzer agents
  - **For security concerns**: security, patterns agents
  - **For integration flows**: integration, database agents
  
  **Success Criteria**:
  
  - Clear exploration roadmap
  - List of agents to deploy in Phase 3
  - Prioritized investigation areas
  
  **Deliverables**:
  
  - Exploration strategy document with:
    - Investigation roadmap
    - Agent deployment plan for Phase 3
    - Priority order for exploration
    - Expected outputs from each exploration
  
  ### Phase 3: Parallel Deep Dives
  
  **Purpose**: Deploy multiple exploration agents simultaneously to gather information efficiently.
