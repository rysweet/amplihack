  # Meeting Synthesizer Skill
  
  Transform raw meeting notes and transcripts into actionable intelligence. This skill extracts critical information from unstructured meeting data and organizes it into structured formats that drive follow-through and accountability.
  
  ## Overview
  
  The Meeting Synthesizer processes meeting notes or transcripts to produce:
  
  - **Action Items**: Clear tasks with owners, due dates, and context
  - **Decisions Made**: Key decisions with justification and implications
  - **Discussion Points**: Important topics, debates, and consensus areas
  - **Follow-up Tasks**: Prioritized task list with next steps
  - **Key Insights**: Patterns, concerns, and emerging themes
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - After team meetings, standups, or planning sessions
  - When converting transcript/notes into structured action items
  - When you need to quickly extract decisions and assign accountability
  - When synthesizing notes for stakeholders who missed the meeting
  - When creating task lists from meeting discussions
  
  ## How to Use This Skill

  1. **Provide the Meeting Content**
     - Share meeting notes (typed or pasted)
