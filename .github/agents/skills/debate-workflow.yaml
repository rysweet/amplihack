  # Debate Workflow Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Implement structured multi-perspective debate for important architectural decisions, design trade-offs, and complex problems where multiple valid approaches exist.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  **USE FOR:**
  
  - Major architectural decisions (framework selection, system design)
  - Complex trade-offs with no clear winner
  - Controversial changes affecting multiple teams
  - High-impact decisions requiring buy-in
  - When perspectives genuinely conflict
  
  **AVOID FOR:**
  
  - Simple implementation choices
  - Decisions with obvious correct answer
  - Time-sensitive hot fixes
  - Minor refactoring
  - Routine feature additions
  
  ## Configuration
  
  ### Core Parameters
  
  **Number of Perspectives:**
  
  - `3` - Default (security, performance, simplicity)
  - `5` - Extended (add: maintainability, user-experience)
  - `7` - Comprehensive (add: scalability, cost)
  
  **Debate Rounds:**
  
  - `2` - Quick (position + challenge)
  - `3` - Standard (position + challenge + synthesis)
  - `4-5` - Deep (multiple challenge/response cycles)
  
  **Convergence Criteria:**
  
  - `100%` - Strong consensus (all perspectives agree)
  - `2/3` - Majority rule (two-thirds agreement)
  - `synthesis` - Facilitator synthesizes best hybrid
  - `evidence` - Follow strongest evidence/arguments
  
  ## Standard Perspective Profiles
  
  **Security Perspective:**
  
  - Focus: Vulnerabilities, attack vectors, data protection
  - Questions: "What could go wrong? How do we prevent breaches?"
  - Agent: security agent
  
  **Performance Perspective:**
  
  - Focus: Speed, scalability, resource efficiency
  - Questions: "Will this scale? What are the bottlenecks?"
  - Agent: optimizer agent
  
  **Simplicity Perspective:**
  
  - Focus: Minimal complexity, ruthless simplification
  - Questions: "Is this the simplest solution? Can we remove abstractions?"
  - Agent: cleanup agent + reviewer agent
  
  **Maintainability Perspective:**
  
  - Focus: Long-term evolution, technical debt
  - Questions: "Can future developers understand this? How hard to change?"
  - Agent: reviewer agent + architect agent
  
  **User Experience Perspective:**
  
  - Focus: API design, usability, developer experience
  - Questions: "Is this intuitive? How will users interact with this?"
  - Agent: api-designer agent
  
  **Scalability Perspective:**
  
  - Focus: Growth capacity, distributed systems
  - Questions: "What happens at 10x load? 100x?"
  - Agent: optimizer agent + architect agent
  
  **Cost Perspective:**
  
  - Focus: Resource usage, infrastructure costs, development time
  - Questions: "What's the ROI? Are we over-engineering?"
  - Agent: analyzer agent
  
  ## Execution Process
  
  ### Step 1: Frame the Decision
  
  - **Use ambiguity agent** to clarify the decision to be made
  - **Use prompt-writer agent** to create clear decision prompt
  - Define decision scope and constraints
  - Identify stakeholder concerns
  - List evaluation criteria
