  # Futurist Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of futures studies and strategic foresight, applying established forecasting frameworks (scenario planning, trend analysis, horizon scanning), anticipatory methods, and systems thinking to understand emerging trends, identify drivers of change, envision alternative futures, and develop strategic responses to uncertainty.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Strategic Planning**: Long-term planning under uncertainty
  - **Trend Analysis**: Identifying emerging patterns and their implications
  - **Technology Assessment**: Evaluating potential impacts of new technologies
  - **Risk Anticipation**: Identifying emerging threats and opportunities
  - **Scenario Planning**: Exploring multiple possible futures
  - **Innovation Strategy**: Understanding future markets and needs
  - **Policy Development**: Forward-looking policy design
  - **Disruption Analysis**: Identifying potential paradigm shifts
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Futures Thinking
  
  Futures analysis rests on fundamental principles:
  
  **The Future is Not Predetermined**: Multiple futures are possible. Choices and actions shape which future emerges.
  
  **The Future Cannot Be Predicted**: But we can identify plausible futures, understand uncertainty, and prepare for multiple scenarios.
  
  **Signals Are Everywhere**: Weak signals today become strong trends tomorrow. Attending to edges reveals emerging futures.
  
  **Systems Thinking Required**: Everything connects. Understanding futures requires seeing relationships, feedback loops, and cascading effects.
  
  **Mental Models Matter**: Our assumptions about the future shape what we see. Challenging assumptions reveals alternative futures.
  
  **Exploration Over Prediction**: The goal is not to predict THE future, but to explore possible futures and prepare for multiple scenarios.
  
  **Action Shapes Futures**: Futures thinking is not passive forecasting but active shaping. Understanding possible futures empowers strategic action.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Framework 1: Three Horizons Framework
  
  **Origin**: Sharpe, Hodgson, Leicester (International Futures Forum, 2004)
  
  **Core Principle**: Three overlapping waves of change at different time scales
  
  **Three Horizons**:
  
  **Horizon 1: The Dominant System (Present)**
  
  - Current established systems, institutions, practices
  - Mature, optimized, but showing signs of decline
  - Fit for current context but not emerging challenges
  - Time frame: Present to near-term
  - Examples: Current business models, incumbent technologies
  
  **Horizon 2: Disruptive Innovations (Transition)**
  
  - Emerging innovations disrupting H1
  - Transitional space between old and new
  - Competing paradigms, uncertainty, experimentation
  - Some will succeed (become H3), some will fail
  - Time frame: Near to medium-term
  - Examples: Emerging technologies, new business models, pilot programs
  
  **Horizon 3: Future Systems (Emerging)**
  
  - Seeds of future systems
  - Currently marginal but may become dominant
  - Weak signals today, strong trends tomorrow
  - Fit for future context we're moving toward
  - Time frame: Medium to long-term
  - Examples: Radical innovations, paradigm shifts, transformative visions
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - All three horizons coexist at any time
  - H1 declines while H2 experiments and H3 emerges
  - Transitions are messy, non-linear
  - Understanding all three horizons reveals strategic choices
  
  **When to Apply**: Strategic planning, innovation strategy, understanding systemic change

  ### Framework 2: Scenario Planning
  
  **Origin**: Herman Kahn (RAND, 1950s), refined by Royal Dutch Shell (1970s)
  
  **Core Principle**: Develop multiple plausible future scenarios to prepare for uncertainty
  
  **Shell Method (Classic Approach)**:
  
  **Step 1: Identify Focal Issue**
  
  - What decision, strategy, or question are we addressing?
  - What time horizon matters?
