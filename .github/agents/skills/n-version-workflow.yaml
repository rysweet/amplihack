  # N-Version Programming Workflow Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Execute N-version programming workflow for critical implementations where multiple independent solutions should be generated and compared to select the best approach.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  **USE FOR:**
  
  - Critical security features (authentication, authorization)
  - Complex algorithms with multiple valid approaches
  - High-risk refactoring of core components
  - Architecture decisions with significant long-term impact
  - When correctness is paramount over speed
  
  **AVOID FOR:**
  
  - Simple CRUD operations
  - Straightforward bug fixes
  - Documentation updates
  - Minor UI tweaks
  - Time-sensitive quick fixes
  
  ## Configuration
  
  ### Core Parameters
  
  **N (Number of Versions):**
  
  - `3` - Default for standard tasks
  - `4-6` - Critical features requiring high confidence
  - `2` - Quick validation of approach
  
  **Selection Criteria** (priority order):
  
  1. Correctness - Meets requirements and passes tests
  2. Security - No vulnerabilities or anti-patterns
  3. Simplicity - Ruthless simplicity, minimal complexity
  4. Philosophy Compliance - Follows project principles
  5. Performance - Efficiency and resource usage
  
  **Agent Diversity Profiles:**
  
  - `conservative` - Proven patterns and safety
  - `innovative` - Novel approaches and optimizations
  - `minimalist` - Ruthless simplicity
  - `pragmatic` - Balance trade-offs for practical solutions
  - `performance-focused` - Optimize for speed and efficiency
  
  ## Execution Process
  
  ### Step 1: Prepare Common Context
  
  - **Use prompt-writer agent** to create crystal-clear specification
  - Document all requirements explicitly
  - Define success criteria measurably
  - Prepare identical task specification for all N versions
  - Identify evaluation metrics upfront
  - **CRITICAL: Capture explicit user requirements that CANNOT be optimized away**
  
  **Output:** Single authoritative specification document
  
  ### Step 2: Generate N Independent Implementations
  
  - Spawn N Claude subprocesses simultaneously
  - Each subprocess receives IDENTICAL task specification
  - **NO context sharing between subprocesses** (true independence)
  - Each uses different agent diversity profile
  - Each produces complete implementation with tests
  - Each works in isolated directory (version_1/, version_2/, etc.)
  
  **Example for N=3:**
  
  - Subprocess 1: Conservative approach (proven patterns, comprehensive error handling)
  - Subprocess 2: Pragmatic approach (balance simplicity and robustness)
  - Subprocess 3: Minimalist approach (ruthless simplification, minimal dependencies)
  
  ### Step 3: Collect and Compare Implementations
  
  - Wait for all N implementations to complete
  - **Use analyzer agent** to examine each implementation
  - **Use tester agent** to run tests for each version
  - Document results in comparison matrix
  
  **Comparison Matrix:**
  
  ```
  | Version | Correctness | Security | Simplicity | Philosophy | Performance | Lines of Code |
  |---------|-------------|----------|------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
  | v1      | PASS        | PASS     | 7/10       | 8/10       | 150ms       | 180           |
  | v2      | PASS        | PASS     | 9/10       | 9/10       | 180ms       | 95            |
  | v3      | FAIL        | N/A      | 10/10      | 7/10       | N/A         | 65            |
  ```
  
  ### Step 4: Review and Evaluate
  
  - **Use reviewer agent** for comprehensive comparison
  - **Use security agent** to evaluate security of each version
  - Apply selection criteria in priority order
