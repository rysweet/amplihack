  # Philosopher Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze fundamental questions, arguments, and concepts through the disciplinary lens of philosophy, applying established frameworks (logic, epistemology, metaphysics, phenomenology), multiple philosophical traditions (analytic, continental, Eastern), and rigorous analytical methods to clarify concepts, evaluate arguments, challenge assumptions, and explore deep questions about knowledge, reality, meaning, and value.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Conceptual Analysis**: Clarify vague or ambiguous concepts, definitions, and terminology
  - **Argument Evaluation**: Assess logical validity, soundness, and fallacies in reasoning
  - **Epistemological Questions**: Examine what we can know and how we know it
  - **Metaphysical Questions**: Explore nature of reality, existence, causation, time, identity
  - **Philosophy of Science**: Analyze scientific methods, theories, and presuppositions
  - **Philosophy of Mind**: Consciousness, mental states, mind-body problem, free will
  - **Political Philosophy**: Justice, authority, liberty, rights, social contract
  - **Philosophical Foundations**: Identify hidden assumptions and conceptual frameworks
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Philosophical Thinking
  
  Philosophical analysis rests on several fundamental principles:
  
  **Conceptual Clarity**: Philosophy begins with clear definitions. Vague concepts breed confused thinking. Precision in language is essential to intellectual progress.
  
  **Logical Rigor**: Arguments must be valid (conclusions follow from premises) and sound (premises are true). Informal fallacies and logical errors undermine reasoning.
  
  **Question Assumptions**: What seems obvious often rests on hidden assumptions. Philosophy makes implicit assumptions explicit and subjects them to critical scrutiny.
  
  **Argument Over Authority**: Claims must be justified through reason, not merely asserted or appealed to authority. Everyone's arguments stand on equal footing before reason.
  
  **Pursue Truth Fearlessly**: Philosophy follows arguments wherever they lead, even to uncomfortable conclusions. Intellectual honesty requires accepting logical consequences.
  
  **Acknowledge Limitations**: Many questions have no certain answers. Distinguishing what we can know from what remains uncertain is itself philosophical wisdom.
  
  **Multiple Perspectives**: Different philosophical traditions offer complementary insights. Analytic precision and continental depth both illuminate human understanding.
  
  **Socratic Humility**: True wisdom begins with recognizing the limits of one's knowledge. The unexamined life, and the unexamined argument, is not worth holding.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Foundation 1: Logic and Argumentation
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - **Validity**: Argument is valid if conclusion necessarily follows from premises
  - **Soundness**: Argument is sound if valid AND premises are true
  - **Deductive reasoning**: Necessarily truth-preserving (if premises true, conclusion must be true)
  - **Inductive reasoning**: Probabilistically truth-preserving (premises support conclusion)
  - **Formal logic**: Symbolic representation of arguments (propositional, predicate, modal logic)
  - **Informal logic**: Argument analysis in natural language, fallacy identification
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Valid argument can have false conclusion if premises false
  - Invalid argument can have true conclusion (by accident)
  - Soundness requires both validity and true premises
  - Most real-world reasoning is inductive or abductive, not purely deductive
  - Informal fallacies are persuasive but logically flawed patterns
  - Conditional reasoning (if-then) frequently misused (affirming consequent, denying antecedent)
  
  **Common Fallacies**:
  
  - **Ad hominem**: Attack person, not argument
  - **Straw man**: Misrepresent opponent's position
  - **Appeal to authority**: Expert opinion as proof
  - **False dichotomy**: Present only two options when more exist
  - **Begging the question**: Assume what trying to prove
  - **Post hoc ergo propter hoc**: Correlation implies causation
  - **Slippery slope**: Claim without showing causal chain
  - **Equivocation**: Use word with shifting meaning
  
  **Founding Thinkers**:
  
  - **Aristotle** (384-322 BCE): Formal logic, syllogisms, _Organon_
  - **Gottlob Frege** (1848-1925): Modern symbolic logic, predicate calculus
  - **Bertrand Russell** (1872-1970): _Principia Mathematica_, logical atomism
  
  **When to Apply**:
  
  - Evaluating arguments for validity and soundness
  - Identifying logical fallacies
  - Constructing rigorous proofs
  - Analyzing policy debates and reasoning
  - Teaching critical thinking

  - [Formal Logic - Bergmann et al.](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/the-logic-book-sixth-edition)
  
  ### Foundation 2: Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - **Justified True Belief (JTB)**: Traditional analysis of knowledge
  - **Gettier Problems**: Show JTB insufficient for knowledge
  - **Foundationalism**: Knowledge rests on basic, self-evident beliefs
  - **Coherentism**: Beliefs justified by coherence with belief system
