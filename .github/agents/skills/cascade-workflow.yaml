  # Cascade Workflow with Graceful Degradation Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Implement graceful degradation through cascading fallback strategies. When optimal approaches fail or timeout, the system automatically falls back to simpler, more reliable alternatives while maintaining acceptable functionality.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  **USE FOR:**
  
  - External service dependencies (APIs, databases)
  - Time-sensitive operations with acceptable degraded modes
  - Operations where partial results are better than no results
  - High-availability requirements (system must always respond)
  - Scenarios where waiting for perfect solution is worse than good-enough solution
  
  **AVOID FOR:**
  
  - Operations requiring exact correctness (no acceptable degradation)
  - Security-critical operations (authentication, authorization)
  - Financial transactions (no room for "approximate")
  - When failures must surface to user (diagnostic operations)
  - Simple operations with no meaningful fallback
  
  ## Configuration
  
  ### Core Parameters
  
  **Timeout Strategy:**
  
  - `aggressive` - Fast failures, quick degradation (5s / 2s / 1s)
  - `balanced` - Reasonable attempts (30s / 10s / 5s) - **DEFAULT**
  - `patient` - Thorough attempts before fallback (120s / 30s / 10s)
  - `custom` - Define your own timeouts
  
  **Fallback Types:**
  
  - `service` - External API → Cached data → Static defaults
  - `quality` - Comprehensive → Standard → Minimal analysis
  - `freshness` - Real-time → Recent → Historical data
  - `completeness` - Full dataset → Sample → Summary
  - `accuracy` - Precise → Approximate → Estimate
  
  **Degradation Notification:**
  
  - `silent` - Log only, no user notification
  - `warning` - Inform user of degradation
  - `explicit` - Detailed explanation of what degraded and why
  
  ## Cascade Level Requirements
  
  **PRIMARY (Optimal):**
  
  - Best possible outcome
  - May depend on external services
  - May be slow or resource-intensive
  - Can fail or timeout
  
  **SECONDARY (Acceptable):**
  
  - Reduced quality but functional
  - More reliable than primary
  - Faster or fewer dependencies
  - Acceptable for users
  
  **TERTIARY (Guaranteed):**
  
  - Always succeeds, never fails
  - No external dependencies
  - Fast and reliable
  - Minimal but functional
  - **CRITICAL: Must be designed to never fail**
  
  ## Execution Process
  
  ### Step 1: Define Cascade Levels
  
  - **Use architect agent** to identify cascade levels
  - Define PRIMARY approach (optimal solution)
  - Define SECONDARY approach (acceptable degradation)
  - Define TERTIARY approach (guaranteed completion)
  - Set timeout for each level
  - Document what degrades at each level
  - **CRITICAL: Ensure tertiary ALWAYS succeeds**
  
  **Example Cascade Definitions:**
  
  **Code Analysis with AI:**
  
  - PRIMARY: GPT-4 comprehensive analysis (timeout: 30s)
  - SECONDARY: GPT-3.5 standard analysis (timeout: 10s)
  - TERTIARY: Static analysis with regex (timeout: 5s)
  
  **External API Data Fetch:**
  
  - PRIMARY: Live API call (timeout: 10s)
  - SECONDARY: Cached data (timeout: 2s)
  - TERTIARY: Default values (timeout: 0s)
  
  **Test Execution:**
