  # Cybersecurity Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of cybersecurity, applying rigorous security frameworks (CIA triad, defense-in-depth, zero-trust), threat modeling methodologies (STRIDE, PASTA, VAST), attack surface analysis, and industry standards (NIST, ISO 27001, MITRE ATT&CK) to understand security risks, identify vulnerabilities, assess threat actors and attack vectors, evaluate defensive controls, and recommend risk mitigation strategies.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Security Incident Analysis**: Investigate breaches, data leaks, ransomware attacks, insider threats
  - **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify weaknesses in systems, applications, networks, processes
  - **Threat Modeling**: Analyze potential attack vectors and threat actors for new systems or changes
  - **Security Architecture Review**: Evaluate design decisions for security implications and gaps
  - **Risk Assessment**: Quantify and prioritize security risks using frameworks like CVSS, FAIR
  - **Compliance Analysis**: Assess adherence to security standards (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)
  - **Incident Response Planning**: Design detection, containment, eradication, and recovery strategies
  - **Security Posture Evaluation**: Assess overall defensive capabilities and maturity
  - **Code Security Review**: Identify security vulnerabilities in software implementations
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Security Thinking
  
  Cybersecurity analysis rests on fundamental principles:
  
  **Defense in Depth**: No single security control is perfect. Layer multiple independent controls so compromise of one doesn't compromise the whole system.
  
  **Assume Breach**: Modern security assumes attackers will penetrate perimeter defenses. Design systems to minimize damage and enable detection when (not if) breach occurs.
  
  **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum access necessary for legitimate function. Every excess permission is an opportunity for exploitation.
  
  **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify. Verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach regardless of network location.
  
  **Security by Design**: Security cannot be bolted on afterward. It must be fundamental to architecture and implementation from the beginning.
  
  **CIA Triad**: Security protects three properties—Confidentiality (only authorized access), Integrity (only authorized modification), Availability (accessible when needed).
  
  **Threat-Informed Defense**: Base defensive priorities on understanding of actual threat actors, their capabilities, motivations, and tactics (threat intelligence).
  
  **Risk-Based Approach**: Perfect security is impossible. Prioritize security investments based on risk (likelihood × impact) to maximize security per dollar spent.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Foundation 1: CIA Triad (Classic Security Model)
  
  **Components**:
  
  **Confidentiality**: Information accessible only to authorized entities
  
  - Protection mechanisms: Encryption, access controls, authentication
  - Threats: Eavesdropping, data theft, unauthorized disclosure
  - Example violations: Data breach, password theft, insider leak
  
  **Integrity**: Information modifiable only by authorized entities in authorized ways
  
  - Protection mechanisms: Hashing, digital signatures, access controls, version control
  - Threats: Tampering, unauthorized modification, malware
  - Example violations: Database manipulation, man-in-the-middle attacks, ransomware encryption
  
  **Availability**: Information and systems accessible when needed by authorized entities
  
  - Protection mechanisms: Redundancy, backups, DDoS mitigation, incident response
  - Threats: Denial of service, ransomware, system destruction
  - Example violations: DDoS attacks, ransomware, infrastructure failures
  
  **Extensions**:
  
  - **Authenticity**: Verified identity of entities and origin of information
  - **Non-repudiation**: Cannot deny taking action
  - **Accountability**: Actions traceable to entities
  
  **Application**: Every security analysis should identify which aspects of CIA triad are at risk and how controls protect each.

  ### Foundation 2: Defense in Depth (Layered Security)
  
  **Principle**: Deploy multiple layers of security controls so compromise of one layer doesn't compromise entire system.
  
  **Historical Origin**: Military defensive strategy—multiple concentric perimeter defenses
  
  **Security Layers**:
  
  1. **Physical**: Facility access controls, locked server rooms
  2. **Network**: Firewalls, network segmentation, IDS/IPS
  3. **Host**: Endpoint protection, host firewalls, patch management
  4. **Application**: Input validation, secure coding, authentication
  5. **Data**: Encryption at rest and in transit, DLP, tokenization
  6. **Human**: Security awareness training, phishing simulation
  
  **Key Insight**: Redundancy is not waste—it's resilience. Even if attacker bypasses firewall, they still face authentication, authorization, monitoring, encryption, and detection controls.
  
  **Application**: Security architecture should have multiple independent defensive layers protecting critical assets.
  
  **Limitation**: Can create complexity and false sense of security if layers are not maintained or are interdependent.
