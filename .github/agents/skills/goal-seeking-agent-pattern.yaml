  # Goal-Seeking Agent Pattern Skill
  
  ## 1. What Are Goal-Seeking Agents?
  
  Goal-seeking agents are autonomous AI agents that execute multi-phase objectives by:
  
  1. **Understanding High-Level Goals**: Accept natural language objectives without explicit step-by-step instructions
  2. **Planning Execution**: Break goals into phases with dependencies and success criteria
  3. **Autonomous Execution**: Make decisions and adapt behavior based on intermediate results
  4. **Self-Assessment**: Evaluate progress against success criteria and adjust approach
  5. **Resilient Operation**: Handle failures gracefully and explore alternative solutions
  
  ### Core Characteristics
  
  **Autonomy**: Agents decide HOW to achieve goals, not just follow prescriptive steps
  
  **Adaptability**: Adjust strategy based on runtime conditions and intermediate results
  
  **Goal-Oriented**: Focus on outcomes (what to achieve) rather than procedures (how to achieve)
  
  **Multi-Phase**: Complex objectives decomposed into manageable phases with dependencies
  
  **Self-Monitoring**: Track progress, detect failures, and course-correct autonomously
  
  ### Distinction from Traditional Agents
  
  | Traditional Agent             | Goal-Seeking Agent            |
  | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
  | Follows fixed workflow        | Adapts workflow to context    |
  | Prescriptive steps            | Outcome-oriented objectives   |
  | Human intervention on failure | Autonomous recovery attempts  |
  | Single-phase execution        | Multi-phase with dependencies |
  | Rigid decision tree           | Dynamic strategy adjustment   |
  
  ### When Goal-Seeking Makes Sense
  
  Goal-seeking agents excel when:
  
  - **Problem space is large**: Many possible paths to success
  - **Context varies**: Runtime conditions affect optimal approach
  - **Failures are expected**: Need autonomous recovery without human intervention
  - **Objectives are clear**: Success criteria well-defined but path is flexible
  - **Multi-step complexity**: Requires coordination across phases with dependencies
  
  ### When to Avoid Goal-Seeking
  
  Use traditional agents or scripts when:
  
  - **Single deterministic path**: Only one way to achieve goal
  - **Latency-critical**: Need fastest possible execution (no decision overhead)
  - **Safety-critical**: Human verification required at each step
  - **Simple workflow**: Complexity of goal-seeking exceeds benefit
  - **Audit requirements**: Need deterministic, reproducible execution
  
  ## 2. When to Use This Pattern
  
  ### Problem Indicators
  
  Use goal-seeking agents when you observe these patterns:
  
  #### Pattern 1: Workflow Variability
  
  **Indicators**:
  
  - Same objective requires different approaches based on context
  - Manual decisions needed at multiple points
  - "It depends" answers when mapping workflow
  
  **Example**: Release workflow that varies by:
  
  - Environment (staging vs production)
  - Change type (hotfix vs feature)
  - Current system state (healthy vs degraded)
  
  **Solution**: Goal-seeking agent evaluates context and adapts workflow
  
  #### Pattern 2: Multi-Phase Complexity
  
  **Indicators**:
  
  - Objective requires 3-5+ distinct phases
  - Phases have dependencies (output of phase N feeds phase N+1)
  - Parallel execution opportunities exist
  - Success criteria differ per phase
  
  **Example**: Data pipeline with phases:
  
  1. Data collection (multiple sources, parallel)
  2. Transformation (depends on collection results)
  3. Validation (depends on transformation output)
  4. Publishing (conditional on validation pass)
  
  **Solution**: Goal-seeking agent orchestrates phases, handles dependencies
  
  #### Pattern 3: Autonomous Recovery Needed
  
  **Indicators**:
  
  - Failures are expected and recoverable
  - Multiple retry/fallback strategies exist
