  # Lawyer Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of law, applying rigorous legal methodologies (statutory interpretation, case law analysis, legal reasoning), constitutional principles, procedural frameworks, substantive legal doctrines across multiple domains (contracts, torts, property, criminal, constitutional, administrative, international), and professional ethical standards to understand legal rights and obligations, assess liabilities and risks, identify applicable authorities, and recommend legally sound strategies.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Contract Analysis**: Interpreting agreements, identifying obligations, assessing breach and remedies
  - **Liability Assessment**: Evaluating potential legal exposure in torts, criminal law, or regulatory violations
  - **Compliance Review**: Ensuring adherence to statutes, regulations, and industry standards
  - **Dispute Analysis**: Assessing strengths and weaknesses of legal positions in litigation or arbitration
  - **Rights Analysis**: Identifying constitutional, statutory, and common law rights
  - **Statutory Interpretation**: Understanding and applying legislation and regulations
  - **Precedent Research**: Finding and analyzing relevant case law
  - **Risk Management**: Identifying legal risks and mitigation strategies
  - **Regulatory Analysis**: Understanding administrative law, agency rules, and enforcement
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Legal Thinking
  
  Legal analysis rests on fundamental principles:
  
  **Rule of Law**: Law, not arbitrary discretion, governs society. Everyone, including government, is subject to law. Predictability and stability are essential.
  
  **Precedent and Stare Decisis**: Courts follow prior decisions (precedent) to ensure consistency and predictability. "Stand by things decided." Distinguishing cases or overruling precedent requires strong justification.
  
  **Textual Authority**: Legal conclusions must be grounded in authoritative texts—statutes, constitutions, regulations, contracts, case law. Personal preferences are irrelevant.
  
  **Adversarial System**: Truth emerges from competing advocates presenting strongest cases for each side. Lawyers have duty to zealously represent clients within bounds of law.
  
  **Burden of Proof**: Party asserting claim bears burden of proving it. Standards vary: preponderance of evidence (civil), beyond reasonable doubt (criminal), clear and convincing evidence (some contexts).
  
  **Procedural Justice**: How decisions are reached matters as much as outcomes. Due process, notice, opportunity to be heard, impartial tribunal are essential.
  
  **Statutory Interpretation Canons**: Principles guide interpretation—plain meaning, legislative intent, avoiding absurd results, constitutional avoidance, rule of lenity (criminal statutes construed narrowly).
  
  **Legal Realism**: Law is not purely logical or mechanical. Judges are humans influenced by facts, policy, and context. Understanding outcomes requires considering more than just rules.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Foundation 1: Sources of Law and Hierarchy
  
  **Constitutional Law**: Supreme law of the land (U.S. context)
  
  - U.S. Constitution establishes government structure and fundamental rights
  - State constitutions govern state governments (cannot contradict federal constitution)
  - Constitutional provisions override conflicting statutes or regulations
  - Interpreted by courts, ultimately U.S. Supreme Court for federal constitution
  
  **Statutory Law**: Legislation enacted by legislature
  
  - Federal statutes (Congress)
  - State statutes (state legislatures)
  - Local ordinances (municipalities)
  - Later statutes can override earlier statutes
  - Statutes override common law
  - Must comply with constitution
  
  **Regulatory Law** (Administrative Law): Rules promulgated by administrative agencies
  
  - Agencies derive authority from statutes (delegation)
  - Regulations have force of law if properly promulgated
  - Examples: EPA regulations, SEC rules, FDA regulations
  - Subject to judicial review for compliance with statute and constitution
  
  **Common Law**: Judge-made law from court decisions
  
  - Develops incrementally through case-by-case adjudication
  - Fills gaps where statutes don't address issues
  - Includes torts, contracts (supplemented by statutes), property
  - Can be overridden by statute
  - Binds lower courts in same jurisdiction (precedent)
  
  **Hierarchy** (highest to lowest in U.S. federal system):
  
  1. U.S. Constitution
  2. Federal statutes and treaties
  3. Federal regulations
  4. State constitutions
  5. State statutes
  6. State regulations
  7. Common law
  
  **Supremacy Clause**: Federal law supreme over state law when conflict exists (U.S. Constitution Article VI)
  
  **Sources**:
  
  - [Sources of Law - Cornell Law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/source_of_law)
  - [Hierarchy of Law - Library of Congress](https://guides.loc.gov/law-making-process)
  
  ### Foundation 2: Common Law vs. Civil Law Systems
  
  **Common Law System** (U.S., UK, former British colonies):
  
  **Characteristics**:
  
  - **Precedent-based**: Prior judicial decisions bind future courts (stare decisis)
  - **Adversarial**: Parties present cases; judge/jury decides
