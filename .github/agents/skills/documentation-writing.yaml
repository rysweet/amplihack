  # Documentation Writing Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Creates high-quality, discoverable documentation following the Eight Rules and Diataxis framework. Ensures all docs are properly located, linked, and contain real runnable examples.
  
  ## When I Activate
  
  I load automatically when you mention:
  
  - "write documentation" or "create docs"
  - "document this feature/module/API"
  - "create a README" or "write a tutorial"
  - "explain how this works"
  - Any request to create markdown documentation
  
  ## Core Rules (MANDATORY)
  
  ### The Eight Rules
  
  1. **Location**: All docs in `docs/` directory
  2. **Linking**: Every doc linked from at least one other doc
  3. **Simplicity**: Plain language, remove unnecessary words
  4. **Real Examples**: Runnable code, not "foo/bar" placeholders
  5. **Diataxis**: One doc type per file (tutorial/howto/reference/explanation)
  6. **Scanability**: Descriptive headings, table of contents for long docs
  7. **Local Links**: Relative paths, context with links
  8. **Currency**: Delete outdated docs, include update metadata
  
  ### What Stays OUT of Docs
  
  **Never put in `docs/`:**
  
  - Status reports or progress updates
  - Test results or benchmarks
  - Meeting notes or decisions
  - Plans with dates
  - Point-in-time snapshots
  
  **Where temporal info belongs:**
  
  - Test results → CI logs, GitHub Actions
  - Status updates → GitHub Issues
  - Progress → Pull Request descriptions
  - Decisions → Commit messages
  
  ## Quick Start
  
  ### Creating a New Document
  
  ```markdown
  # [Feature Name]
  
  Brief one-sentence description of what this is.
  
  ## Quick Start
  
  Minimal steps to get started (3-5 steps max).
  
  ## Contents
  
  - [Configuration](#configuration)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
  
  ## Configuration
  
  Step-by-step setup with real examples.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Common use cases with runnable code.
  
  ## Troubleshooting
  
  Common problems and solutions.
  ```
  
  ### Document Types (Diataxis)
  
  | Type        | Purpose       | Location          | User Question           |
  | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
  | Tutorial    | Learning      | `docs/tutorials/` | "Teach me how"          |
  | How-To      | Doing         | `docs/howto/`     | "Help me do X"          |
  | Reference   | Information   | `docs/reference/` | "What are the options?" |
  | Explanation | Understanding | `docs/concepts/`  | "Why is it this way?"   |
  
  ## Workflow
  
  ### Step 1: Determine Document Type
  
  Ask: What is the reader trying to accomplish?
  
  - Learning something new → Tutorial
  - Solving a specific problem → How-To
  - Looking up details → Reference
  - Understanding concepts → Explanation
  
  ### Step 2: Choose Location
