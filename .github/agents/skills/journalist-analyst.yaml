  # Journalist Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of journalism, applying established reporting frameworks (5 Ws and H, inverted pyramid), investigative methods, source evaluation techniques, and ethical journalism principles to understand what happened, verify facts, identify information gaps, assess newsworthiness, and evaluate how stories are told.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Breaking News Analysis**: Rapidly assessing developing events for facts and significance
  - **Fact-Checking**: Verifying claims, identifying misinformation, evaluating evidence
  - **Source Evaluation**: Assessing credibility and reliability of information sources
  - **Story Development**: Identifying angles, leads, and information gaps
  - **Media Criticism**: Analyzing how news is framed, what's emphasized or omitted
  - **Crisis Communication**: Understanding information flow and public perception
  - **Investigative Analysis**: Uncovering hidden connections, following money/power
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Journalistic Thinking
  
  Journalistic analysis rests on fundamental principles:
  
  **Facts Are Sacred**: Accuracy is paramount. Verify before publishing. Correct errors promptly.
  
  **Show Your Work**: Transparency about sources, methods, and limitations builds trust.
  
  **Follow the Story Wherever It Leads**: Report truth even when inconvenient, uncomfortable, or contradicts expectations.
  
  **Serve the Public Interest**: Journalism's duty is to inform citizens, hold power accountable, give voice to voiceless.
  
  **Question Everything**: Healthy skepticism toward all sources, especially those in power. Trust but verify.
  
  **Context Matters**: Facts without context can mislead. Provide background, perspective, proportion.
  
  **Be Fair and Balanced**: Present multiple perspectives. Distinguish reporting from opinion. Minimize harm.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Framework 1: The 5 Ws and H (Fundamental Questions)
  
  **Origin**: Classical rhetoric (Hermagoras of Temnos, 1st century BCE), refined in journalism
  
  **Core Principle**: Complete story answers six essential questions
  
  **The Six Questions**:
  
  **1. Who?**
  
  - Who is involved (actors, stakeholders)?
  - Who is affected?
  - Who made decisions?
  - Who has authority or expertise?
  - Who wins? Who loses?
  
  **2. What?**
  
  - What happened?
  - What is the event, action, or development?
  - What are the key facts?
  - What changed?
  - What are the consequences?
  
  **3. When?**
  
  - When did this occur?
  - What is the timeline?
  - When did key events happen?
  - When will effects be felt?
  - Why does timing matter?
  
  **4. Where?**
  
  - Where did this happen?
  - What is the geographic scope?
  - Where are effects felt?
  - Why does location matter?
  
  **5. Why?**
  
  - Why did this happen?
  - What are the causes?
  - What motivations drove actions?
  - Why does this matter?
  - Why now?
  
  **6. How?**
  
  - How did this happen?
  - What is the mechanism or process?
  - How do we know (sourcing)?
  - How widespread or significant?
  - How will this unfold?
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Systematic framework ensures completeness
  - Identifies information gaps
  - Guides reporting and questioning
  - Provides structure for analysis
