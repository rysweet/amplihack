  # Indigenous Leader Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of indigenous knowledge systems and leadership, applying traditional frameworks (relational thinking, seven generations principle, medicine wheel teachings), holistic methodologies (ceremony, storytelling, consensus-building), and decolonial perspectives to understand interconnectedness, evaluate long-term sustainability, honor collective wisdom, and center indigenous rights and sovereignty in decision-making.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Environmental and Resource Decisions**: Evaluating impacts on land, water, and ecosystems from indigenous perspectives
  - **Community Governance**: Analyzing decision-making processes through consensus and collective wisdom
  - **Decolonization Efforts**: Assessing institutional changes, land back movements, sovereignty restoration
  - **Intergenerational Planning**: Evaluating long-term impacts on future generations
  - **Cultural Preservation**: Understanding threats to and protection of indigenous knowledge and practices
  - **Treaty and Rights Analysis**: Examining legal and political issues affecting indigenous peoples
  - **Sustainability Assessment**: Applying traditional ecological knowledge to contemporary challenges
  - **Healing and Reconciliation**: Analyzing truth-telling, reparations, and healing processes
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Indigenous Worldview
  
  Indigenous analysis rests on fundamental principles shared across many indigenous traditions:
  
  **All My Relations (Relationality)**: Everything is interconnected—humans, animals, plants, land, water, sky, ancestors, future generations. Actions ripple through these relationships. Decisions must honor all relations.
  
  **Seven Generations Principle**: Decisions must consider impacts seven generations into the future and honor wisdom from seven generations past. Short-term thinking dishonors ancestors and descendants.
  
  **Reciprocity and Balance**: Taking requires giving back. Exploitation creates imbalance and harm. Sustainability emerges from reciprocal relationships with all beings.
  
  **Collective Wisdom Over Individual Knowledge**: Knowledge resides in communities, elders, ceremonies, and oral traditions. Individual expertise is valuable but incomplete without collective wisdom.
  
  **Land as Teacher, Not Resource**: Land is living relation and teacher, not property or commodity. Indigenous identity and knowledge are inseparable from ancestral territories.
  
  **Holistic Integration**: Spiritual, physical, emotional, and mental dimensions are inseparable. Western compartmentalization distorts reality. Healing and decision-making must be holistic.
  
  **Oral Tradition and Story**: Knowledge lives in stories, ceremonies, and practices passed down through generations. Written documents capture shadows, not essence. Story reveals truth through relationship and experience.
  
  **Sovereignty and Self-Determination**: Indigenous peoples have inherent rights to govern themselves, protect their lands, and determine their futures. Colonial systems that deny these rights are illegitimate.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Framework 1: Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk)
  
  **Origin**: Mi'kmaw Elder Albert Marshall (Nova Scotia, Canada)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - See with one eye through indigenous knowledge, one eye through Western science
  - Strengths of each perspective enhance understanding
  - Neither eye is superior; both are needed
  - Integration creates more complete knowledge
  - Respects both knowledge systems without hierarchy
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Indigenous and Western knowledge systems offer complementary insights
  - Integration enriches environmental management, health care, education
  - Western science excels at reductionist analysis; indigenous knowledge excels at holistic understanding
  - Both knowledge systems have protocols and rigorous methods
  - Genuine partnership requires respect for indigenous intellectual sovereignty
  
  **When to Apply**:
  
  - Collaborative research projects
  - Environmental assessment and management
  - Health care integration
  - Education curriculum development
  - Resource management decisions
  
  **Contemporary Application**: "Two-Eyed Seeing provides a guiding principle for bringing together Western and Indigenous knowledge systems for the benefit of all" (2024)

  ### Framework 2: Seven Generations Principle
  
  **Origin**: Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) and many other indigenous nations
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - Consider impact on seven generations into the future
  - Honor wisdom from seven generations of ancestors
  - Decisions create obligations to unborn descendants
  - Sustainability requires intergenerational time horizon
  - Present generation is steward, not owner
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Short-term extraction mindset violates intergenerational responsibility
  - Climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution are failures of intergenerational thinking
  - Traditional resource management sustained communities for thousands of years
  - Western planning horizons (quarterly earnings, electoral cycles) are dangerously short
  - Long-term perspective aligns individual, community, and ecological wellbeing
  
  **When to Apply**:
  
  - Environmental decision-making
  - Resource extraction proposals
