  # Economist Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of economics, applying established economic frameworks (supply/demand analysis, game theory, general equilibrium), multiple schools of thought (Classical, Keynesian, Austrian, Behavioral), and rigorous methodological approaches to understand market dynamics, incentive structures, resource allocation efficiency, and policy implications.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Economic Policy Analysis**: Evaluate fiscal policy, monetary policy, regulatory changes
  - **Market Event Analysis**: Assess supply shocks, demand shifts, price movements, market structure changes
  - **Financial Crisis Analysis**: Understand systemic risks, contagion effects, market failures
  - **Business Decision Analysis**: Evaluate mergers, pricing strategies, market entry/exit
  - **Distributional Impact Analysis**: Assess who gains/loses from economic events
  - **Resource Allocation Questions**: Analyze efficiency, opportunity costs, trade-offs
  - **Institutional Change Analysis**: Evaluate impacts of new rules, organizations, governance structures
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Economic Thinking
  
  Economic analysis rests on several fundamental principles:
  
  **Incentives Matter**: People respond to incentives in predictable ways. Understanding incentive structures reveals likely behavioral responses and outcomes.
  
  **Opportunity Cost**: Every choice involves trade-offs. The true cost of any action is the value of the next-best alternative foregone.
  
  **Marginal Analysis**: Decisions are made at the margin. Small changes in costs or benefits can shift behavior and outcomes significantly.
  
  **Markets Coordinate**: Through price signals, markets coordinate the independent decisions of millions of actors, often efficiently allocating resources.
  
  **Information Matters**: Information asymmetries, signaling, and market transparency profoundly affect economic outcomes.
  
  **Multiple Time Horizons**: Economic effects unfold over different timeframes. Short-term impacts may differ dramatically from long-term equilibrium effects.
  
  **Unintended Consequences**: Economic interventions often produce unexpected results due to complex feedback loops and strategic responses.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### School 1: Classical Economics (18th-19th Century)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - Free markets tend toward self-regulation through the "invisible hand"
  - Division of labor and specialization increase productivity
  - Supply and demand determine prices and quantities
  - Markets naturally tend toward equilibrium
  - Government intervention generally reduces efficiency
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Individuals pursuing self-interest can generate socially beneficial outcomes
  - Competition drives efficiency and innovation
  - Price mechanisms transmit information and coordinate behavior
  - Trade creates mutual gains
  
  **Founding Thinker**: Adam Smith (1723-1790)
  
  - Work: _The Wealth of Nations_ (1776)
  - Contributions: Invisible hand mechanism, division of labor, market self-regulation
  
  **When to Apply**:
  
  - Analyzing long-run market equilibria
  - Evaluating effects of market liberalization
  - Understanding competitive dynamics
  - Assessing trade and specialization benefits

  - [Classical Economic Theory - Mises Institute](https://mises.org/quarterly-journal-austrian-economics/review-classical-economic-theory-and-modern-economy)
  
  ### School 2: Keynesian Economics (1930s-Present)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - Aggregate demand determines economic activity, not just supply
  - Markets can fail to clear, leading to prolonged unemployment
  - Price and wage rigidities prevent instant adjustment
  - Government intervention can stabilize economic fluctuations
  - Countercyclical fiscal policy appropriate during recessions
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Economies can get stuck at sub-optimal equilibria
  - Demand management matters for short-run economic performance
  - Animal spirits and expectations affect investment and consumption
  - Multiplier effects amplify fiscal policy impacts
  
  **Founding Thinker**: John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)
  
  - Work: _The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money_ (1936)
  - Contributions: Theory of aggregate demand, involuntary unemployment, case for stabilization policy
  
  **When to Apply**:
  
  - Analyzing recessions and economic downturns
  - Evaluating fiscal stimulus or austerity
  - Understanding short-run economic fluctuations
  - Assessing demand-side policies
