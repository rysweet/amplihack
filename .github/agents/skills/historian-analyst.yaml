  # Historian Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of history, applying rigorous historical methods (source criticism, comparative analysis, periodization), temporal frameworks (continuity/change, causation), and historiographical perspectives to understand how the past shapes the present, identify historical patterns and precedents, and contextualize contemporary events within long-term trajectories.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Historical Contextualization**: Understanding how past events shape current situations
  - **Precedent Identification**: Finding historical parallels and analogies
  - **Long-Term Analysis**: Examining patterns and trends over decades or centuries
  - **Causation Over Time**: Tracing how causes unfold across time periods
  - **Continuity and Change**: Identifying what persists vs. what transforms
  - **Source Analysis**: Evaluating primary sources and historical evidence
  - **Comparative History**: Comparing events, periods, or regions across time
  - **Path Dependency**: Understanding how historical choices constrain present options
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Historical Thinking
  
  Historical analysis rests on fundamental principles:
  
  **Time Matters**: Events must be understood in temporal sequence and context. Anachronism distorts understanding.
  
  **Context is Essential**: Events cannot be understood in isolation from their social, economic, political, and cultural contexts.
  
  **Sources are Evidence**: History is built from evidence—primary sources, documents, artifacts—that must be critically evaluated.
  
  **Causation is Complex**: Multiple causes operate at different levels and timeframes. Simple monocausal explanations are usually wrong.
  
  **Change and Continuity Coexist**: Some things transform while others persist. Understanding both is crucial.
  
  **Perspective Shapes Interpretation**: All history is interpretive. Historians' contexts and biases shape their narratives.
  
  **Comparison Reveals Patterns**: Comparing across time and space reveals underlying patterns and causal relationships.

  ## Historical Methods (Expandable)
  
  ### Method 1: Source Analysis and Criticism
  
  **Primary Sources**: "Original documents, artifacts, or other pieces of information created at the time under study"
  
  **Types**:
  
  - Eyewitness accounts
  - Official documents (laws, treaties, records)
  - Personal documents (diaries, letters)
  - Physical artifacts
  - Visual sources (photographs, art, maps)
  - Oral histories
  
  **Source Criticism Questions**:
  
  1. **Authenticity**: Is this source what it claims to be?
  2. **Provenance**: Who created it? When? Where? Why?
  3. **Context**: What were circumstances of creation?
  4. **Perspective**: What biases or viewpoint does author have?
  5. **Audience**: For whom was this created?
  6. **Reliability**: How accurate is the information?
  7. **Corroboration**: Do other sources support or contradict this?
  
  **Secondary Sources**: "Accounts written after the fact with benefit of hindsight that are interpretations of primary sources"
  
  **Note**: "A secondary source may become a primary source depending on researcher's perspective"

  ### Method 2: Comparative Historical Analysis
  
  **Definition**: "Approach offering explanations of large-scale outcomes by exploring similarities and differences across cases to unveil causal mechanisms"
  
  **Applications**:
  
  - Revolutions
  - Democratic or authoritarian rule
  - Path dependent institutional processes
  - Policy continuity and change
  
  **Approaches**:
  
  - Cross-temporal comparison (same place, different times)
  - Cross-spatial comparison (different places, same time)
  - Cross-case comparison (different cases, similar outcomes)
  
  **Analytical Tools**:
  
  **Critical Junctures**: "Periods of significant change that produce durable effects, unsettling previous institutional patterns and opening new periods of path dependency"
  
  **Path Dependency**: "When a nation has started to move in one direction, costs to revert are very high"
  
  **Gradual Change**: Incremental transformations that cumulatively produce conspicuous change
