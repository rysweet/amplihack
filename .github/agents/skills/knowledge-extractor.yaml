  # Knowledge Extractor Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  This skill automatically extracts, synthesizes, and preserves knowledge from conversations, debugging sessions, failed attempts, and solved problems. It converts ephemeral interactions into persistent organizational knowledge that improves future performance.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Session End Analysis**: Extract learnings before session context is lost
  - **After Complex Debugging**: Capture root causes and solutions while fresh
  - **Following Failed Attempts**: Document what didn't work and why
  - **Successful Problem Solving**: Preserve solutions for future reuse
  - **New Pattern Discovery**: Identify patterns that should be documented
  - **Repeated Workflows**: Recognize when to create new specialized agents
  - **Cross-Session Learning**: Build organizational memory from individual sessions
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Knowledge Preservation
  
  **Session Context**: Ephemeral conversation context that will be lost without active preservation
  **Persistent Knowledge**: Structured learnings that improve future performance
  **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying when solutions are repeated and should be automated
  **Organizational Growth**: Converting individual learning into system-wide improvement
  
  ## Knowledge Extraction Framework
  
  ### Three Types of Knowledge Extraction
  
  #### 1. Discoveries - Novel Insights and Root Causes
  
  **What it captures**: Problems encountered, root causes identified, solutions implemented
  
  **When to extract**:
  
  - After solving a complex bug
  - When debugging reveals unexpected behavior
  - When discovering wrong assumptions
  - After identifying missing functionality
  - When learning why something failed
  
  **Format for DISCOVERIES.md**:
  
  ```markdown
  ## [Brief Title] (YYYY-MM-DD)
  
  ### Issue
  
  What problem or challenge was encountered?
  
  ### Root Cause
  
  Why did this happen? What was the underlying issue?
  
  ### Solution
  
  How was it resolved? Include code examples if relevant.
  
  ### Key Learnings
  
  What insights were gained? What should be remembered?
  
  ### Prevention
  
  How can this be avoided in the future?
  ```
  
  **Quality Criteria**:
  
  - ✅ Specific problem, not generic advice
  - ✅ Root cause clearly identified
  - ✅ Working solution included
  - ✅ Learning generalized for reuse
  - ✅ Prevention strategy documented
  
  #### 2. Patterns - Reusable Solutions
  
  **What it captures**: Proven solutions to recurring problems, architectural approaches, design patterns
  
  **When to extract**:
  
  - After solving a problem similar to known patterns
  - When recognizing a repeated problem type
  - When implementing a proven solution
  - When discovering a best practice that works
  - When solution applies across multiple contexts
  
  **Format for PATTERNS.md**:
  
  ```markdown
  ## Pattern: [Name]
  
  ### Challenge
  
  What problem does this pattern solve?
  
  ### Solution
  
  How does the pattern work? Include code/examples.
  
  ### Key Points
