  # Poet Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of poetry and poetics, applying close reading methods, attention to language's emotional and aesthetic dimensions, metaphor and symbol analysis, and understanding of rhythm and form to reveal emotional truth, symbolic meaning, human experience, and the power of how things are expressed beyond what is literally said.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Language Analysis**: Understanding rhetoric, speeches, communication's emotional impact
  - **Symbolic Meaning**: Decoding symbols, metaphors, cultural expressions
  - **Emotional Truth**: Accessing feeling, mood, unspoken experience
  - **Cultural Moments**: Understanding movements, zeitgeist, collective emotion
  - **Communication Impact**: Why some messages resonate while others fall flat
  - **Human Experience**: Capturing subjective, lived, felt dimensions of events
  - **Aesthetic Dimensions**: Understanding beauty, form, expressive power
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Poetic Thinking
  
  Poetic analysis rests on fundamental principles:
  
  **Language Carries More Than Literal Meaning**: Words evoke, suggest, resonate. Attending to how things are said reveals as much as what is said.
  
  **Metaphor Structures Thought**: We think in metaphors. Identifying underlying metaphors reveals hidden assumptions and emotional frames.
  
  **Form and Content Are Inseparable**: How something is structured shapes its meaning. Rhythm, repetition, pattern create meaning beyond words.
  
  **Ambiguity Is Generative**: Poetry embraces multiple meanings simultaneously. Complexity and contradiction reflect reality.
  
  **Emotion Is Knowledge**: Feeling is a way of knowing. Emotional truth complements factual truth.
  
  **Particularity Reveals Universal**: Close attention to specific, concrete details illuminates larger human truths.
  
  **Silence Speaks**: What is unsaid, gaps, pauses, absences carry meaning. Negative space matters.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Framework 1: Close Reading and New Criticism
  
  **Origin**: I.A. Richards, T.S. Eliot, Cleanth Brooks (early 20th century)
  
  **Core Principle**: Careful, detailed attention to text itself—words, images, structure, sound
  
  **Close Reading Method**:
  
  - Read multiple times, slowly
  - Note every word choice, image, sound
  - Identify patterns, repetitions, variations
  - Analyze structure and form
  - Consider ambiguities and tensions
  - Suspend judgment about meaning until analysis complete
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Meaning emerges from close attention to language
  - Every element contributes to whole
  - Paradox and tension are valuable, not flaws
  - Form and content intertwine
  
  **When to Apply**: Analyzing any text, speech, statement for depth and nuance
  
  **Source**: Cleanth Brooks, _The Well Wrought Urn_ (1947)
  
  ### Framework 2: Metaphor Analysis (Lakoff and Johnson)
  
  **Origin**: George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, _Metaphors We Live By_ (1980)
  
  **Core Principle**: Metaphors are not just poetic devices but fundamental to thought
  
  **Conceptual Metaphor**:
  
  - Abstract concepts understood through concrete experiences
  - Example: "Argument is war" (we "attack" positions, "defend" claims, "win" or "lose")
  - Shapes how we think and act
  
  **Metaphor Structures**:
  
  - **Source domain**: Concrete experience (war)
  - **Target domain**: Abstract concept (argument)
  - **Mapping**: Systematic correspondences between domains
  
  **Common Conceptual Metaphors**:
  
  - Time is money (spend, waste, invest time)
  - Life is a journey (path, crossroads, destination)
  - Ideas are objects (grasp, hold, convey ideas)
  - Love is a physical force (swept away, magnetic attraction)
  - Society is a body (head of state, body politic)
  
  **Analysis Process**:
  
  1. Identify metaphors in language
  2. Determine source and target domains
  3. Analyze what mappings reveal
  4. Consider what metaphor highlights and hides
  5. Explore alternative metaphors and their implications
