  # Learning Path Builder Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  This skill creates personalized, structured learning paths that guide users through mastering new technologies, frameworks, or concepts. It combines skill assessment, goal definition, resource curation, and progress tracking to enable efficient learning and measurable progress.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **New Technology Adoption**: Learning a new framework, language, or tool
  - **Onboarding**: Bringing team members up to speed on project technologies
  - **Hackathon Preparation**: Building required skills before a competition
  - **Career Development**: Structured path for advancing in a particular domain
  - **Knowledge Gaps**: Filling specific skill gaps in your technical stack
  - **Upskilling**: Transitioning from one technology to another
  - **Learning Optimization**: Creating efficient paths tailored to your learning style
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Personalized Progressive Learning
  
  **Assessment** → **Goal Setting** → **Path Sequencing** → **Resource Curation** → **Progress Tracking** → **Adaptation**
  
  A good learning path:
  
  - Matches current skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  - Aligns with learning goals and timeline
  - Sequences concepts from simple to complex
  - Mixes multiple resource types (docs, tutorials, exercises, projects)
  - Provides checkpoints and milestones
  - Adapts to learning style and feedback
  
  ## Learning Path Components
  
  Every personalized learning path includes:
  
  ### 1. Skills Assessment
  
  - Current skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
  - Relevant prior knowledge
  - Learning experience preference
  - Time availability
  - Career/project goals
  
  ### 2. Goal Definition
  
  - Primary learning objective
  - Target proficiency level
  - Timeline and milestones
  - Success metrics
  - Constraints and dependencies
  
  ### 3. Concept Sequence
  
  - Prerequisite concepts
  - Progressive complexity levels
  - Learning foundations first
  - Builds practical understanding over time
  
  ### 4. Resource Curation
  
  - Official documentation
  - High-quality tutorials
  - Interactive exercises
  - Real-world projects
  - Community resources
  
  ### 5. Learning Checkpoints
  
  - Milestone assessments
  - Practical exercises
  - Mini-projects
  - Reflection points
  - Progress validation
  
  ### 6. Progress Tracking
  
  - Completed modules
  - Assessed skill gains
  - Time investment
  - Confidence levels
  - Feedback integration
  
  ## Step-by-Step Assessment Process
  
  ### Step 1: Assess Current Skill Level
  
  Ask targeted questions to understand:
  
  1. **Technical Background**
     - Languages/frameworks you already know
     - Similar technologies you've used
     - Years of programming experience
     - Relevant professional experience
  
  2. **Learning Style Preference**
     - Hands-on (learn by doing)
     - Theory-first (understand concepts)
     - Project-based (learn via real problems)
     - Visual (diagrams, videos)
     - Reading (documentation, blogs)
  
  3. **Time Availability**
