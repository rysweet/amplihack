  # Psychologist Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of psychology, applying established psychological frameworks (behavioral, cognitive, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological), research methodologies, and empirical findings to understand human behavior, cognition, emotion, motivation, social influence, mental health, and individual differences in context.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Decision-Making Analysis**: Understanding cognitive biases, heuristics, and irrational choices
  - **Leadership Analysis**: Examining leader traits, behaviors, effectiveness, and influence
  - **Group Dynamics**: Understanding conformity, obedience, groupthink, and collective behavior
  - **Persuasion and Influence**: Analyzing propaganda, marketing, social influence tactics
  - **Trauma and Crisis Response**: Understanding psychological impacts of disasters, violence, loss
  - **Mental Health Events**: Analyzing prevalence, stigma, treatment, and policy implications
  - **Developmental Milestones**: Understanding behavior in developmental context (child, adolescent, adult, aging)
  - **Conflict and Aggression**: Understanding violence, prejudice, discrimination, reconciliation
  - **Behavioral Change**: Understanding motivation, habit formation, intervention effectiveness
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Psychological Thinking
  
  Psychological analysis rests on fundamental principles:
  
  **Empiricism**: Knowledge derives from systematic observation and experimentation. Claims must be tested against evidence, not intuition or authority.
  
  **Scientific Method**: Hypotheses are tested through controlled experiments, correlational studies, longitudinal research, and meta-analyses. Replication and peer review ensure validity.
  
  **Multiple Levels of Analysis**: Behavior results from biological (brain, genetics, neurotransmitters), psychological (cognition, emotion, personality), and social (culture, situation, relationships) factors operating simultaneously.
  
  **Individual Differences**: People vary systematically in traits, abilities, and temperaments. Universal principles must account for variation.
  
  **Development**: Humans change across lifespan. Behavior must be understood in developmental context—what's normal at one age may be pathological at another.
  
  **Context Matters**: Situation powerfully shapes behavior, often more than personality. Understanding requires analyzing person-situation interaction.
  
  **Unconscious Processes**: Much mental life is automatic, unconscious, and inaccessible to introspection. Behavior is not always explained by conscious reasoning.
  
  **Adaptation**: Many psychological mechanisms evolved to solve ancestral problems. Understanding adaptive function illuminates behavior.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Foundation 1: Cognitive Psychology (Information Processing)
  
  **Core Premise**: Mind is information processing system. Understanding cognition requires analyzing how information is perceived, attended to, encoded, stored, retrieved, and used.
  
  **Historical Development**:
  
  - **Cognitive Revolution** (1950s-60s): Reaction against behaviorism
  - Computer metaphor: Mind as information processor
  - Key figures: George Miller, Ulric Neisser, Herbert Simon
  
  **Key Concepts**:
  
  **Attention**:
  
  - **Selective attention**: Focus on relevant information, filter irrelevant (cocktail party effect)
  - **Divided attention**: Multitasking limitations (inattentional blindness)
  - **Sustained attention**: Vigilance decrements over time
  - Bottleneck: Limited attentional capacity
  
  **Memory Systems**:
  
  - **Sensory memory**: Brief (< 1 sec) retention of sensory information
  - **Short-term/Working memory**: Limited capacity (7±2 items), brief duration (~20 sec)
    - Phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, episodic buffer, central executive (Baddeley)
  - **Long-term memory**: Unlimited capacity, permanent storage
    - Declarative: Episodic (personal experiences), Semantic (facts)
    - Procedural: Skills and habits
  
  **Memory Processes**:
  
  - **Encoding**: Transfer to long-term memory (elaborative rehearsal, organization, imagery)
  - **Storage**: Maintenance over time (consolidation, reconsolidation)
  - **Retrieval**: Accessing stored information (recall vs. recognition, retrieval cues)
  - **Forgetting**: Interference, decay, retrieval failure
  
  **Memory Fallibility**:
  
  - Reconstructive: Memories are reconstructed, not replayed
  - Misinformation effect: Post-event information alters memory (Loftus)
  - False memories: People can remember events that didn't happen
  - Flashbulb memories: Vivid but not necessarily accurate
  
  **Decision-Making and Judgment**:
  
  **Dual-Process Theory** (Kahneman & Tversky):
  
  - **System 1**: Fast, automatic, intuitive, emotional, unconscious
  - **System 2**: Slow, deliberate, logical, conscious, effortful
  
  **Heuristics**: Mental shortcuts that are efficient but error-prone
  
  - **Availability heuristic**: Judge frequency by ease of recall (overestimate dramatic events)
  - **Representativeness heuristic**: Judge by similarity to prototype (ignore base rates)
  - **Anchoring and adjustment**: Influenced by initial value
  - **Affect heuristic**: Feelings guide judgment
  
  **Biases**:
