  # PR Review Assistant Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Philosophy-aware pull request reviews that go beyond syntax and style to check alignment with amplihack's core development principles. This skill reviews PRs not just for correctness, but for ruthless simplicity, modular architecture, and zero-BS implementation.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **PR Code Reviews**: Review PRs against amplihack philosophy principles
  - **Philosophy Compliance**: Check that code embodies ruthless simplicity and brick module design
  - **Refactoring Suggestions**: Identify over-engineering and suggest concrete simplifications
  - **Architecture Verification**: Verify modular design and clear contracts
  - **Test Coverage**: Assess test adequacy for changed functionality
  - **Design Assessment**: Catch over-engineering before it gets merged
  
  ## Core Philosophy: What We Review For
  
  ### 1. Ruthless Simplicity
  
  Every line of code must justify its existence. We ask:
  
  - **Can this be simpler?** Does each function do one thing well?
  - **Is this necessary now?** Or is it future-proofing?
  - **Are there unnecessary abstractions?** Extra layers that don't add value?
  - **Can we remove lines?** The best code is code that doesn't exist.
  
  ### 2. Modular Architecture (Brick & Studs)
  
  Code should be organized as self-contained modules with clear connections:
  
  - **Brick** = Self-contained module with ONE clear responsibility
  - **Stud** = Public contract (functions, API, data models) others connect to
  - **Regeneratable** = Can be rebuilt from specification without breaking connections
  
  ### 3. Zero-BS Implementation
  
  No shortcuts, stubs, or technical debt:
  
  - **No TODOs in code** = Actually implement or don't include it
  - **No NotImplementedError** = Except in abstract base classes
  - **No mock data** = Real functionality from the start
  - **No dead code** = Remove unused code
  - **Every function works** = Or it doesn't exist
  
  ### 4. Quality Over Speed
  
  - **Robust implementations** = Better than quick fixes
  - **Long-term maintainability** = Not short-term gains
  - **Clear error handling** = Errors visible, not swallowed
  - **Tested behavior** = Verify contracts at module boundaries
  
  ## Review Process
  
  ### Step 1: Understand the Changes
  
  Start by understanding what the PR changes:
  
  1. **Read the PR description** to understand intent
  2. **Identify affected modules** and their scope
  3. **Note the dependencies** changed or added
  4. **Understand the problem** being solved
  
  ### Step 2: Check Philosophy Alignment
  
  Review each change against amplihack principles:
  
  #### Ruthless Simplicity Check
  
  - Is every line necessary?
  - Are there unnecessary abstractions?
  - Could this be implemented more simply?
  - Is there future-proofing or speculation?
  - Are there duplicate or similar functions?
  - Could conditional logic be simplified?
  
  #### Module Structure Check
  
  - Does the change respect module boundaries?
  - Are public contracts clear and documented?
  - Are internal utilities isolated?
  - Does the module have ONE clear responsibility?
  - Are there circular dependencies?
  
  #### Zero-BS Check
  
  - Are there TODOs or NotImplementedError calls?
  - Are mock or test data exposed in production code?
  - Is error handling explicit and visible?
  - Are all functions working implementations?
  - Is there dead code or unused variables?
  
  ### Step 3: Identify Over-Engineering
  
  Look for common over-engineering patterns:
  
  - **Over-abstraction**: Base classes, protocols, factories for no clear benefit
  - **Generic "frameworks"**: Building infrastructure for hypothetical needs
  - **Premature optimization**: Complex algorithms for non-critical paths
  - **Configuration complexity**: 50-line config when 5-line default would work
  - **Future-proofing**: "We might need this someday" code
