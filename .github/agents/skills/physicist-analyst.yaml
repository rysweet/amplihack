  # Physicist Analyst Skill
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of physics, applying fundamental physical laws (conservation of energy, momentum, mass; thermodynamics; electromagnetism; relativity), quantitative modeling, dimensional analysis, and systems dynamics to understand causation, evaluate constraints, assess technological feasibility, analyze energy systems, and identify physical limits that govern complex systems.
  
  ## When to Use This Skill
  
  - **Energy Systems Analysis**: Evaluating energy production, conversion, storage, and efficiency
  - **Technology Feasibility Assessment**: Determining whether proposed technologies respect physical laws and constraints
  - **Complex Systems Dynamics**: Analyzing emergent behavior, feedback loops, scaling laws, and nonlinear systems
  - **Climate Physics**: Understanding radiative forcing, heat transfer, atmospheric dynamics
  - **Infrastructure and Engineering**: Assessing structural integrity, materials behavior, scaling
  - **Information and Computation**: Analyzing fundamental limits on information processing and communication
  - **Physical Constraints on Solutions**: Identifying hard physical limits vs. engineering or economic challenges
  - **Quantitative Modeling**: Building mathematical models grounded in physical principles
  - **Dimensional Analysis and Scaling**: Understanding how systems behave across scales
  
  ## Core Philosophy: Physical Thinking
  
  Physics analysis rests on fundamental principles:
  
  **Conservation Laws are Inviolable**: Energy, momentum, mass-energy, angular momentum, and charge are conserved in all processes. Any claimed violation indicates error in analysis or measurement. These laws constrain all possible events and technologies.
  
  **Thermodynamics Sets Absolute Limits**: The laws of thermodynamics (especially the second law: entropy increases) establish absolute efficiency limits for energy conversion, set direction of processes, and constrain technological possibilities. No cleverness can circumvent them.
  
  **Quantification and Measurement**: Physics demands precise, quantitative understanding. Vague qualitative claims must be replaced with measurable quantities, units, and numerical predictions. "How much?" and "With what uncertainty?" are essential questions.
  
  **Symmetry and Invariance**: Physical laws exhibit symmetries (e.g., laws are same everywhere, same in all directions, same over time). Symmetry principles reveal deep truths and guide prediction.
  
  **Causality and Mechanisms**: Physics seeks mechanistic understanding: What physical processes cause observed phenomena? Correlation without mechanism is insufficient. Models must specify causal pathways grounded in physical laws.
  
  **Emergence from Fundamentals**: Complex phenomena emerge from simpler, more fundamental laws. Understanding requires identifying relevant scales and principles. Reductionism is powerful but not always sufficient; emergent properties matter.
  
  **Models and Approximations**: All models simplify reality. Good models capture essential physics while neglecting irrelevant details. Know your assumptions and approximations.
  
  **Dimensional Analysis**: Checking units and scaling relationships reveals errors, guides intuition, and provides order-of-magnitude estimates without detailed calculation.
  
  **Physical Intuition**: Develop sense for plausible magnitudes, timescales, and behaviors. "Does this answer make physical sense?" is a powerful check.

  ## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)
  
  ### Framework 1: Classical Mechanics and Conservation Laws
  
  **Core Principles**:
  
  - Objects move according to Newton's laws (or Lagrangian/Hamiltonian formulations)
  - Force causes acceleration: F = ma
  - Action and reaction are equal and opposite
  - Momentum conserved in isolated systems
  - Energy conserved (kinetic + potential + other forms)
  - Angular momentum conserved
  
  **Key Insights**:
  
  - Conservation laws are among the most powerful tools in physics
  - They hold regardless of complexity of interactions
  - They enable "before and after" analysis without knowing details
  - Violations signal external forces or energy transfer
  
  **Applications**:
  
  - Collisions and impacts (vehicles, projectiles, particles)
  - Orbital mechanics (satellites, planets)
  - Mechanical systems (machines, structures)
  - Ballistics and projectile motion
  
  **Limitations**:
  
  - Breaks down at very high speeds (relativity needed)
  - Breaks down at very small scales (quantum mechanics needed)
  - Deterministic (quantum mechanics introduces fundamental randomness)
  
  **When to Apply**:
  
  - Macroscopic, low-speed systems
  - Mechanical engineering problems
  - Trajectory and motion analysis
  - Energy and momentum transfer

  - [Conservation Laws - HyperPhysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/conser.html)
  
  ### Framework 2: Thermodynamics and Energy
  
  **Four Laws of Thermodynamics**:
  
  **Zeroth Law**: If A and B are in thermal equilibrium, and B and C are in thermal equilibrium, then A and C are in thermal equilibrium. (Establishes temperature as meaningful concept)
  
  **First Law**: Energy is conserved. ΔU = Q - W (change in internal energy = heat added - work done)
  
  - Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted between forms
  - "You can't win" - can't get more energy out than you put in
  
  **Second Law**: Entropy of isolated system increases over time. ΔS ≥ 0
