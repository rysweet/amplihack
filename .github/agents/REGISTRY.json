      "description": "Use this agent when you need to understand how knowledge, concepts, or ideas have evolved over time, trace the lineage of current understanding, identify abandoned but potentially valuable approaches, or recognize when old solutions might solve new problems. This agent excels at temporal analysis of knowledge evolution, paradigm shift documentation, and preserving the 'fossil record' of ideas that may become relevant again. Examples: <example>Context: User wants to understand how a programming paradigm evolved. user: 'How did functional programming concepts evolve from their mathematical origins to modern implementations?' assistant: 'I'll use the knowledge-archaeologist agent to trace the evolution of functional programming concepts through time.' <commentary>The user is asking about the historical evolution of ideas, so the knowledge-archaeologist agent is perfect for excavating the temporal layers of this concept's development.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User is researching why certain architectural patterns fell out of favor. user: 'Why did service-oriented architecture (SOA) decline and what lessons were lost?' assistant: 'Let me invoke the knowledge-archaeologist agent to analyze the decay patterns of SOA and identify valuable concepts that were abandoned.' <commentary>This requires understanding paradigm shifts and preserving potentially valuable 'extinct' ideas, which is the knowledge-archaeologist's specialty.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User notices similarities between old and new approaches. user: 'This new microservices pattern reminds me of something from the 1970s distributed computing era.' assistant: 'I'll use the knowledge-archaeologist agent to trace these lineages and identify if this is a revival or reincarnation of older concepts.' <commentary>Detecting revival patterns and tracing concept genealogies is a core capability of the knowledge-archaeologist agent.</commentary></example>",

      "description": "Use this agent when processing articles, papers, or documents to extract knowledge components for synthesis. This agent should be used proactively after reading or importing articles to build a structured knowledge base. It excels at identifying atomic concepts, relationships between ideas, and preserving productive tensions or contradictions in the source material. Examples: <example>Context: The user has just imported or read an article about distributed systems. user: \"I''ve added a new article about CAP theorem to the knowledge base\" assistant: \"I''ll use the concept-extractor agent to extract the key concepts and relationships from this article\" <commentary>Since new article content has been added, use the concept-extractor agent to process it and extract structured knowledge components.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user is building a knowledge synthesis system and needs to process multiple articles. user: \"Process these three articles on microservices architecture\" assistant: \"Let me use the concept-extractor agent to extract and structure the knowledge from these articles\" <commentary>Multiple articles need processing for knowledge extraction, perfect use case for the concept-extractor agent.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user wants to understand contradictions between different sources. user: \"These two papers seem to disagree about event sourcing benefits\" assistant: \"I''ll use the concept-extractor agent to extract and preserve the tensions between these viewpoints\" <commentary>When dealing with conflicting information that needs to be preserved rather than resolved, the concept-extractor agent is ideal.</commentary></example>",

Perfect for when you''re stuck on complex problems, seeking innovative solutions, or need to find unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated knowledge components. <example>Context: The user wants to find innovative solutions by combining unrelated concepts. user: \"I''m trying to optimize our database architecture but feel stuck in conventional approaches\" assistant: \"Let me use the insight-synthesizer agent to explore revolutionary connections and find breakthrough approaches to your database architecture challenge\" <commentary>Since the user is seeking new perspectives on a complex problem, the insight-synthesizer agent will discover unexpected connections and simplification opportunities.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user needs to identify patterns across different domains. user: \"We keep seeing similar failures in our ML models, API design, and user interfaces but can''t figure out the connection\" assistant: \"I''ll deploy the insight-synthesizer agent to identify meta-patterns across these different domains and find the underlying principle\" <commentary>The user is looking for cross-domain patterns, so use the insight-synthesizer agent to perform pattern-pattern recognition.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Proactive use when complexity needs radical simplification. user: \"Our authentication system has grown to 15 different modules and 200+ configuration options\" assistant: \"This level of complexity suggests we might benefit from a fundamental rethink. Let me use the insight-synthesizer agent to search for simplification cascades\" <commentary>Proactively recognizing excessive complexity, use the insight-synthesizer to find revolutionary simplifications.</commentary></example>",
