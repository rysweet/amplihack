# Reporting Standards

## Report Structure

All reports should follow this structure:

### Summary (Always Visible)

- Brief overview of findings
- Key metrics and statistics
- Overall assessment

### Detailed Findings (Collapsible when lengthy)

- Specific issues with file paths and line numbers
- Evidence and examples
- Severity/priority assessment

### Recommendations (Always Visible)

- Actionable next steps
- Prioritized by impact
- Realistic effort estimates

## Formatting Guidelines

1. **Header Hierarchy**: Use h3 (###) or lower for all section headers
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Wrap lengthy details in `<details>` tags
3. **Tables**: Use markdown tables for structured data
4. **Code Blocks**: Use proper syntax highlighting
5. **Links**: Include relevant GitHub issue/PR links

## Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: Verify all data before reporting
- **Completeness**: Cover all critical aspects
- **Clarity**: Write for a technical but non-expert audience
- **Actionability**: Every finding should enable action
