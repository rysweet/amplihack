"""Test suite for platform bridge module.

Philosophy:
- TDD approach: Tests written before implementation
- 60% unit tests with heavy mocking
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Clear behavior-focused test names

Testing Pyramid:
- 60% Unit tests (fast, isolated)
- 30% Integration tests (component interaction)
- 10% E2E tests (complete workflows)
