# Test Reliability Tracking
# Updated by smart-test skill after test runs
# Tests with reliability < 0.8 are excluded from Tier 1 (fast) runs

version: 1
last_updated: null # Will be set on first update

# Reliability structure:
# tests:
#   tests/path/test_file.py::test_name:
#     passes: 95
#     failures: 5
#     reliability: 0.95
#     last_failure: "2025-11-20"
#     flaky_reason: null  # or description of why it's flaky

tests: {}
# Thresholds:
# - 1.0: Perfect (always passes)
# - 0.8-0.99: Stable (included in Tier 1)
# - 0.5-0.79: Flaky (excluded from Tier 1, investigate)
# - < 0.5: Unreliable (consider quarantine)

# To update reliability:
# 1. Run tests and capture results
# 2. Tell Claude: "Update test reliability with these results"
# 3. Skill will increment pass/failure counts
