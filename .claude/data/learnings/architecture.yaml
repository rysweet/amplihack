    summary: "This is an example architecture learning"
    insight: |
      Architecture learnings capture design decisions and their rationale.
      For example: "Use composition over inheritance for flexible agent design."
    example: |
      # Composition example
      class Agent:
          def __init__(self, tools: list[Tool]):
              self.tools = tools  # Compose with tools
