      "actual": "# Answer: Creating a New Flutter Project\n\n## The Command\n\nThe command to create a new Flutter project is:\n\n```\nflutter create my_app\n```\n\n## How This Command Works\n\n**Basic Structure:**\n- `flutter create` is the base command that initiates project creation\n- `my_app` is the project name (you can replace this with your desired project name)\n\n## Application Context\n\nThis command fits into the broader Flutter development workflow as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Before using `flutter create`, you need to:\n   - Download the Flutter SDK from flutter.dev\n   - Add Flutter to your system PATH\n   - Verify installation using `flutter doctor`\n\n2. **Project Creation**: Run `flutter create my_app` to generate a new project with:\n   - Complete project structure\n   - The main application code in `lib/main.dart`\n   - A `pubspec.yaml` file for dependency management\n\n3. **Post-Creation Steps**: After creating the project, you would typically:\n   - Navigate into the project directory\n   - Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies\n   - Use `flutter run` to execute the app (requires an emulator or physical device)\n   - Use `flutter test` to run tests\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\n# Create a new Flutter project named \"my_first_app\"\nflutter create my_first_app\n\n# Navigate into the project\ncd my_first_app\n\n# Run the app\nflutter run\n```\n\nThis command is the essential starting point for any Flutter development project, generating all necessary files and folder structure automatically.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly provides the expected answer 'flutter create my_app' and explains that the project name can be replaced. While the agent includes extensive additional context about the Flutter workflow, this extra information is accurate, helpful, and does not detract from the core answer. For an L4 (Procedural Learning) question, providing the procedural context around the command demonstrates proper understanding of how the command fits into the larger workflow. The answer is factually accurate and fully addresses the question."

      "expected": "Run 'flutter upgrade' first",
      "actual": "# Answer: What to Do If Flutter Doctor Shows Version Conflicts\n\nBased on the provided facts, here's how to address version conflicts shown by `flutter doctor`:\n\n## Primary Solution: Run Flutter Upgrade\n\n**The command to resolve version conflicts is:**\n```\nflutter upgrade\n```\n\nAccording to Fact 4, \"Running 'flutter upgrade' resolves version conflicts.\" This is the direct solution to your problem.\n\n## How This Fits Into the Flutter Troubleshooting Workflow\n\n### 1. **Diagnosis Phase**\n- `flutter doctor` (Fact 3) verifies your Flutter installation and checks all dependencies\n- When it detects version conflicts, it will display warnings or errors\n\n### 2. **Resolution Phase**\n- Run `flutter upgrade` to update Flutter to the latest compatible version\n- This command updates the Flutter SDK and resolves version mismatches between Flutter components\n\n### 3. **Additional Troubleshooting (If Needed)**\n\nIf `flutter upgrade` doesn't fully resolve the issues, you may need to address related problems:\n\n- **For Android SDK issues**: Install Android Studio (Fact 1)\n- **For dependency cache problems**: Run `flutter pub cache repair` (Fact 11)\n- **After upgrading**: Run `flutter doctor` again to verify all issues are resolved\n\n## Why This Works\n\nVersion conflicts typically occur when:\n- Your Flutter SDK is outdated\n- Dependencies require newer Flutter versions\n- Components are mismatched after partial updates\n\nThe `flutter upgrade` command synchronizes all Flutter components to compatible versions, eliminating these conflicts.\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter running `flutter upgrade`, execute `flutter doctor` again to confirm all version conflicts are resolved and your development environment is properly configured.",
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the primary solution 'flutter upgrade' and explains it clearly. However, for L4 (Procedural Learning), the answer significantly over-elaborates beyond the expected step-by-step procedure. While the additional context about diagnosis, verification, and related troubleshooting might be helpful, it introduces information not requested and potentially goes beyond what was taught in the facts. The core answer is correct but the excessive elaboration and inclusion of tangential steps (Android Studio installation, pub cache repair) that aren't directly part of resolving version conflicts deviates from the focused procedural response expected. The answer demonstrates understanding but lacks the precision expected at L4."

      "score": 0.5,
      "reasoning": "The agent provides relevant Flutter workflow content but misses key specific commands from the expected answer. Expected answer requires: 1) flutter create my_app, 2) cd my_app, 3) edit lib/main.dart, 4) add dependencies to pubspec.yaml, 5) flutter pub get, 6) flutter test. Agent correctly mentions flutter create and pub get, but omits critical steps like 'cd my_app', 'edit lib/main.dart', and the specific 'flutter test' command (though testing is mentioned generically). The agent also adds extraneous information about prerequisites, platform considerations, and troubleshooting that weren't requested. For L4 (Procedural Learning), the step-by-step procedure must be accurate and complete - this answer has significant gaps in the required workflow steps."

      "score": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the first two steps (flutter create weather_app, cd weather_app) and understands the need to add dependencies. However, there's a significant discrepancy: the agent suggests 'flutter pub add http' as the modern approach, while the expected answer specifies manually adding 'http: ^1.0.0' to pubspec.yaml followed by 'flutter pub get'. While 'flutter pub add' is indeed a valid and modern command that achieves the same result, it doesn't match the exact procedural steps requested in the expected answer. The agent demonstrates good understanding but provides an alternative procedure rather than the specific one being tested. For L4 (Procedural Learning), following the exact expected sequence matters."
