      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is perfect. It correctly identifies the medal counts at Day 7 (18) and Day 9 (26), performs the accurate calculation (26 - 18 = 8), and arrives at the correct answer of 8 medals. The response demonstrates strong temporal reasoning (L3) by organizing facts by time period, showing the calculation step-by-step, and verifying the result. The additional context about which specific days these medals were won on adds value without introducing any errors."

      "score": 0.5,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies Norway's +5 improvement and shows good methodological reasoning, but fails to provide a complete answer. The expected answer shows Italy at +4 (5 to 9) and US at +2 (4 to 6) for Day 10, suggesting this data was available in the source material. The agent claims Day 10 data is missing for these countries and hedges with 'I cannot definitively answer,' when the expected answer treats this as straightforward. The agent gets the winner correct (Norway) but misses Italy's significant +4 improvement and understates US improvement, making the answer incomplete for an L3 temporal reasoning task."

      "score": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "This is an L3 (Temporal Reasoning) question requiring the agent to compute changes over time. The agent claims it cannot determine the trend due to missing day-by-day data, but the expected answer shows there WAS sufficient information in the facts to calculate that Italy gained +3 golds between Days 7-9 and +1 gold between Days 9-10. The agent correctly identified that Italy had 8 total golds as of Day 9, but failed to extract or calculate the necessary comparative data points to describe the acceleration trend. The agent's thorough explanation of what's missing demonstrates good analytical thinking, but ultimately fails to answer the core question that was answerable from the provided facts."
