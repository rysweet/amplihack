      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is comprehensive and accurate. It correctly identifies Italy's 2026 performance (8 golds) and compares it to their previous best (5 golds from 2006 Turin), directly matching the expected answer. The agent goes beyond the minimum requirement by providing additional context including the numerical difference (+3 medals), percentage improvement (60%), historical context, and explicit verification. All core facts are correct and the L3 temporal reasoning is properly demonstrated by comparing performances across different years."

      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identified Italy as the country with the most medals (2) mentioned in the athlete achievements article, matching the expected answer. The agent properly listed both Italian athletes (Federica Brignone and Lisa Vittozzi) and showed clear work by enumerating all athletes mentioned, counting medals by country, and arriving at the correct conclusion. The agent also appropriately distinguished between the athlete achievements article and overall medal standings, demonstrating strong comprehension of what the question was asking."

      "question": "What makes the 2026 Olympics historically significant for Italy?",
      "level": "L2",
      "reasoning_type": "cross_source_synthesis",
      "expected": "First Winter Olympics in Italy since 1956 (70-year gap) and Italy already exceeded their previous best gold medal count",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, the 2026 Olympics are historically significant for Italy for **two major reasons**:\n\n## 1. **70-Year Return to Hosting**\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina mark Italy's first time hosting the Winter Olympics since 1956 (Fact 9). This 70-year gap makes it a momentous return for the country as a Winter Olympic host nation (Fact 3).\n\n## 2. **Best-Ever Olympic Performance**\nItaly achieved its greatest Winter Olympics performance in history at these Games, winning **8 gold medals** (Fact 10). This surpasses their previous record of 5 gold medals set at the 2006 Turin Games (Fact 11).\n\n## Reasoning:\nThe historical significance comes from the **convergence of these two factors** - Italy not only returned to the Olympic stage as host after seven decades, but they also delivered their best performance ever on home soil. This combination of hosting duties and record-breaking achievement makes the 2026 Olympics a landmark moment in Italian winter sports history.\n\nThe facts also show that Italian athletes like Federica Brignone (alpine skiing) and Lisa Vittozzi (biathlon) contributed to this success with home victories (Facts 16-17), adding to the national pride and historical importance of the event.\n\nThis represents a complete answer based on the available facts, which directly address what makes these Olympics historically significant for Italy.",
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the 70-year gap since Italy last hosted (1956) and mentions Italy's record 8 gold medals exceeding their previous best of 5. However, there's a critical error: the agent states Italy 'achieved' this performance at the 2026 Games as if they already happened, when the expected answer indicates Italy 'already exceeded' their previous best, suggesting this occurred before 2026. The agent appears to have misunderstood the temporal context - the significance is that Italy had already surpassed their record BEFORE hosting in 2026, not during the 2026 Games. This is a significant gap in understanding for an L2 synthesis task, though the core factual elements are present."
