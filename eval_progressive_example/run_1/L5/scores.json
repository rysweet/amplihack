      "question": "How many people watched the 2026 opening ceremony?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "contradiction_detection",
      "expected": "There are conflicting reports: IOC estimates 1.2 billion viewers, while independent analysts report 800 million viewers",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, there are **conflicting reports** about the viewership for the 2026 Winter Olympics opening ceremony:\n\n**Higher estimate:** 1.2 billion viewers worldwide\n- Facts 1 and 10 state that the opening ceremony \"was watched by an estimated 1.2 billion viewers worldwide\" and that this was \"the most-watched Winter Olympics opening ceremony in history,\" surpassing Beijing 2022's 900 million viewers.\n\n**Lower estimate:** 800 million viewers globally\n- Facts 11 and 13 state that the ceremony \"attracted approximately 800 million viewers globally,\" representing a decline of about 100 million viewers compared to Beijing 2022's 900 million.\n\n**The discrepancy:**\nThese facts present contradictory information from what appear to be different sources or analyses. The 1.2 billion figure suggests record-breaking viewership, while the 800 million figure suggests a decline from the previous Olympics.\n\nWithout additional context to reconcile these conflicting reports (such as whether one counts only traditional TV viewership while the other includes digital streaming, or whether these are preliminary vs. final figures), I cannot provide a definitive single answer. However, both sources agree the ceremony was held in Milan and that there was significant digital/social media engagement (Fact 4).",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Perfect L5 response. The agent correctly identifies both conflicting reports (1.2 billion from IOC vs 800 million from independent analysts), clearly acknowledges the contradiction, provides specific fact references, and appropriately explains they cannot provide a definitive answer due to the conflicting information. This demonstrates excellent contradiction handling, which is the core requirement for L5 questions."

      "question": "Why might the two sources disagree about viewership numbers?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "contradiction_reasoning",
      "expected": "Different measurement methodologies (IOC preliminary data vs independent analysts), different counting methods (traditional TV only vs including streaming), or different time windows measured",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, **the two sources disagree significantly about the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony viewership numbers:**\n\n**Source 1 (Facts 1-3):** Reports **1.2 billion viewers** worldwide\n- Claims this surpassed the previous record of 900 million from Beijing 2022\n- Notes the data is preliminary and comes from the International Olympic Committee\n\n**Source 2 (Fact 4):** Reports **800 million viewers**\n- Indicates this was actually a decline of 100 million viewers compared to Beijing 2022's 900 million\n- Provides context about shifting media consumption patterns\n\n## Why They Might Disagree:\n\n**1. Different Measurement Methods:**\n- Source 1 may be counting total viewership across ALL platforms (traditional TV + streaming + digital)\n- Source 2 appears to focus primarily on traditional TV viewership, explicitly noting the shift away from traditional viewing\n\n**2. Timing of Data Collection:**\n- Both sources indicate preliminary data, but they may have been released at different points\n- One may include delayed/on-demand viewing while the other counts only live viewing\n\n**3. What's Being Counted:**\n- Source 1's higher number (1.2 billion) might include social media engagement and digital interactions\n- Source 2's lower number (800 million) seems to specifically measure traditional broadcast viewership, as it explicitly discusses the decline in traditional viewing despite \"record social media interactions\"\n\n**Most Likely Explanation:** The sources are measuring different things. Source 2 actually supports this interpretation by noting that despite lower traditional TV viewership, there were record social media interactions\u2014suggesting total engagement across all platforms could indeed be higher, which would align with Source 1's claim of 1.2 billion.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent provides a comprehensive L5 response that clearly identifies the contradiction between sources (1.2B vs 800M viewers) and offers multiple plausible explanations for the disagreement. The agent covers all key points from the expected answer: different measurement methodologies (IOC preliminary vs independent analysts implicitly referenced through 'Source 1' vs 'Source 2'), different counting methods (traditional TV only vs including streaming/digital platforms), and different time windows (live vs delayed viewing). The agent goes beyond the expected answer by synthesizing additional evidence from the facts about social media engagement to support their reasoning about why the numbers might differ. This demonstrates excellent contradiction handling by not only acknowledging the conflict but also reasoning through possible explanations using available evidence."

      "question": "Which viewership figure would you consider more reliable and why?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "source_credibility",
      "expected": "Independent analysts (800M) may be more reliable because they explicitly mention methodology and account for fragmentation across platforms, while IOC figure is 'preliminary' and may have organizational bias toward reporting higher numbers",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, there are **two conflicting viewership figures** for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony:\n\n## The Two Figures:\n\n1. **1.2 billion viewers** - Described as \"historic\" and \"record-breaking,\" surpassing Beijing 2022's 900 million\n2. **800 million viewers** - Representing a decline of 100 million from Beijing 2022's 900 million\n\n## Which is More Reliable?\n\n**The 800 million figure appears more reliable** for the following reasons:\n\n### 1. **Internal Consistency**\nThe 800 million figure aligns logically with the stated comparison to Beijing 2022 (900 million), showing a documented 100 million viewer decline. The 1.2 billion figure contradicts this by claiming an increase instead.\n\n### 2. **Contextual Support**\nThe facts explain the 800 million figure with credible context: changing viewing habits, increased fragmentation across streaming platforms, and a shift toward digital engagement. This narrative is consistent with broader media consumption trends.\n\n### 3. **Data Limitations Acknowledged**\nBoth sources cite the International Olympic Committee as the source, and the data is noted as \"preliminary.\" However, the 1.2 billion claim lacks explanation for why it would contradict the documented decline trend.\n\n### 4. **Realistic Trajectory**\nA decline from 900M to 800M reflects realistic patterns in traditional TV viewership, while a jump to 1.2 billion would be unprecedented and unexplained.\n\n**Note:** The facts indicate that despite lower traditional viewership, the 2026 ceremony achieved \"record social media interactions,\" which might explain confusion if different metrics (TV only vs. total digital engagement) were conflated in the 1.2 billion figure.",
      "score": 0.5,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies and analyzes the contradiction (L5 requirement met), providing detailed reasoning about the 800M figure. However, it completely misses the key points from the expected answer: (1) that independent analysts provided the 800M figure with explicit methodology, (2) that the IOC provided the preliminary 1.2B figure, and (3) that organizational bias is a critical factor. The agent incorrectly states both figures cite the IOC as source. While the analysis shows good critical thinking, it fails to identify the source credibility distinction that is central to determining reliability."
