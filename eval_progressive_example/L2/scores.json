      "question": "How does Italy's 2026 gold medal performance compare to their previous best?",
      "level": "L2",
      "reasoning_type": "cross_source_synthesis",
      "expected": "Italy has 8 golds in 2026, surpassing their previous best of 5 golds from 2006 Turin",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, **Italy's 2026 gold medal performance significantly exceeds their previous best**.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n**Current Performance (2026):**\n- Italy has won **8 gold medals** at the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics (as of February 15, 2026)\n\n**Previous Best:**\n- Italy's previous best performance was **5 gold medals** achieved at the 2006 Turin Games\n\n**Comparison:**\nItaly's 2026 performance represents a **60% improvement** over their previous best (3 additional gold medals). Fact #1 explicitly confirms this, stating that \"Italy's current tally of 8 gold medals at the 2026 Games already surpasses their previous best performance.\"\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- This strong performance has placed Italy in **second place overall** in the medal standings with 22 total medals\n- They trail only Norway (26 total medals, 12 gold medals)\n- Italy is significantly ahead of other major winter sports nations like the United States (5 gold), Germany (4 gold), and Sweden (3 gold)\n\nThe facts clearly indicate that Italy is having their best Winter Olympics performance ever in terms of gold medals, and the games may not even be complete yet (the data is \"as of February 15\"), meaning they could potentially add more medals.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is excellent and exceeds the expected answer. It correctly identifies the key facts: Italy has 8 golds in 2026, surpassing their previous best of 5 golds from 2006 Turin. The agent goes beyond the expected answer by calculating the 60% improvement (3 additional medals), providing relevant context about Italy's overall standing, and noting that the games may not be complete. All information is accurate and directly addresses the L2 synthesis requirement of comparing Italy's current performance to their historical best."

      "question": "Which country's individual athletes won the most medals mentioned in the athlete achievements article?",
      "level": "L2",
      "reasoning_type": "cross_source_synthesis",
      "expected": "Italy with 2 athletes mentioned (Federica Brignone and Lisa Vittozzi)",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, **Norway's individual athletes won the most medals mentioned in the athlete achievements article**.\n\n## Reasoning:\n\nWhen examining the specific athlete achievements mentioned in the facts, I can identify the following individual medal wins:\n\n**Norway:**\n- Johannes Klaebo won his 9th career Olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing relay (Fact 1)\n\n**Italy:**\n- Federica Brignone won gold in giant slalom (Fact 2)\n- Lisa Vittozzi won gold in biathlon pursuit (Fact 17)\n\n**Netherlands:**\n- Femke Kok won gold (and set an Olympic record) in 500m speed skating (Fact 18)\n\nWhile only one specific Norwegian athlete achievement is mentioned (Klaebo's gold), the facts also show that Norway leads the overall medal standings with 26 total medals and 12 gold medals (Facts 3, 6). This dominant position suggests Norwegian athletes collectively won more medals than athletes from other countries.\n\nHowever, I should note that the facts primarily provide **team medal counts** rather than comprehensive individual athlete achievements. The question asks specifically about \"individual athletes\" and their medals \"mentioned in the athlete achievements article,\" and based on the explicitly mentioned individual achievements, each country (Norway, Italy, and Netherlands) has 1-2 specific athlete accomplishments listed. \n\nIf interpreting the question as asking which country's athletes contributed to the highest medal count overall, the answer is clearly **Norway** with 26 total medals.",
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The agent incorrectly answers Norway instead of Italy. While the agent does list the facts correctly (showing Italy has 2 individual athletes mentioned - Brignone and Vittozzi - versus Norway's 1 athlete mentioned - Klaebo), it then contradicts its own data by selecting Norway based on overall team medal counts rather than the number of individual athletes mentioned. The question explicitly asks about 'individual athletes...mentioned in the athlete achievements article,' which is an L2 synthesis task requiring counting mentioned athletes per country. The correct answer is Italy with 2 athletes. The agent's reasoning shows it identified the relevant information but failed to properly synthesize it to answer the specific question asked."

      "question": "What makes the 2026 Olympics historically significant for Italy?",
      "level": "L2",
      "reasoning_type": "cross_source_synthesis",
      "expected": "First Winter Olympics in Italy since 1956 (70-year gap) and Italy already exceeded their previous best gold medal count",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, the 2026 Olympics are historically significant for Italy for two key reasons:\n\n## 1. **First Winter Olympics in Italy in 70 Years**\nAccording to fact 10, the 2026 Winter Olympics are \"the first Winter Olympics held in Italy since the 1956 Cortina Games.\" This represents a 70-year gap between hosting opportunities, making it a momentous return to the international stage for Italian winter sports.\n\n## 2. **Record-Breaking Medal Performance**\nItaly is achieving unprecedented success at these home Games:\n- **Best-ever gold medal count**: With 8 gold medals as of February 15 (fact 11), Italy has already surpassed their previous record of 5 gold medals from the 2006 Turin Games (fact 17)\n- **Strong overall standing**: Italy holds second place in the medal standings with 22 total medals (fact 4), trailing only Norway\n\nThe combination of hosting the Games for the first time in seven decades AND simultaneously achieving their best-ever performance creates a doubly historic moment. Italian athletes like Federica Brignone (giant slalom gold) and Lisa Vittozzi (biathlon pursuit gold) are capitalizing on home advantage to deliver breakthrough results.\n\nThis represents both a symbolic return of the Winter Olympics to Italy and a tangible peak in Italian winter sports achievement.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer perfectly captures both key elements of historical significance: (1) the 70-year gap since Italy last hosted the Winter Olympics in 1956, and (2) Italy surpassing their previous best gold medal count of 5 from 2006 Turin with 8 golds. The answer is well-structured, provides specific facts with references, and includes relevant context about Italy's medal standing and athlete performances. The synthesis of information across multiple sources is accurate and comprehensive."
