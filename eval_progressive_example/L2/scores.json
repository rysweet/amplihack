      "expected": "Italy has 8 golds in 2026, surpassing their previous best of 5 golds from 2006 Turin",
      "actual": "# Italy's 2026 Gold Medal Performance Compared to Previous Best\n\n## Temporal Organization of Italy's Gold Medal Performance\n\n**Previous Best (2006 Turin Games):**\n- Gold medals: 5\n\n**Current Performance (2026 Milan-Cortina Games, as of February 15):**\n- Gold medals: 8\n\n## Analysis\n\nItaly's 2026 Winter Olympics gold medal performance represents a **significant improvement of +3 gold medals** compared to their previous best.\n\n### Specific Comparison:\n- **Previous best:** 5 gold medals at the 2006 Turin Games (Facts 14, 15)\n- **2026 performance:** 8 gold medals at the Milan-Cortina Games (Facts 4, 8, 13)\n- **Improvement:** +3 gold medals (60% increase over their previous record)\n\n### Key Context:\n\n1. **Historic Achievement:** The facts explicitly state that \"Italy's 8 gold medals at the 2026 Games surpasses their previous best of 5 gold medals from 2006\" (Fact 15), confirming this is Italy's best-ever Winter Olympics gold medal performance.\n\n2. **Home Advantage Factor:** This performance comes at Italy's first Winter Olympics hosting in 70 years, with a gap between the 1956 Cortina Games and the 2026 Milan-Cortina Games (Fact 12). The home advantage appears to have contributed to this breakthrough performance.\n\n3. **Timing Note:** These figures are current as of February 15, 2026 (Facts 2, 4, 8), with the Games running through February 21, 2026 (Fact 17). Italy's final gold medal count could potentially increase further before the Games conclude.\n\n### Overall Standing:\nAs of February 15, Italy ranks second overall in the medal standings with 22 total medals (8 gold, 7 silver, 7 bronze), behind Norway's 26 total medals (Facts 4, 8).\n\n**Sources:** Facts 4, 8, 13, 14, 15 from \"Historical Context of Milan-Cortina 2026\" and \"2026 Winter Olympics Medal Update - February 15\"",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer perfectly addresses the L3 (Temporal Reasoning) question by correctly identifying Italy's 2026 performance (8 golds) and comparing it to their previous best (5 golds from 2006 Turin). The core factual comparison matches the expected answer exactly. The agent goes beyond the expected answer by providing additional relevant context including the +3 medal improvement, percentage increase, timing notes, and historical context about home advantage. All additional information enhances rather than detracts from the core answer, and the agent properly cites sources. This is a comprehensive, accurate response that fully satisfies the question requirements."

      "actual": "To answer which country's individual athletes won the most medals mentioned in the athlete achievements article, I need to identify the specific athletes mentioned and count their medals.\n\n## Individual Athletes Mentioned in the Achievements Article:\n\nFrom Fact 1, the athlete achievements article covers notable performances in cross-country skiing, alpine skiing, biathlon, and speed skating. The specific athletes mentioned are:\n\n1. **Johannes Klaebo (Norway)** - Won his 9th career Olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing relay (Fact 3)\n\n2. **Federica Brignone (Italy)** - Won gold in giant slalom (Fact 4)\n\n3. **Femke Kok (Netherlands)** - Set an Olympic record (mentioned in Fact 1 as achieving record-breaking performance in speed skating)\n\n## Medal Count by Country:\n\nLet me count the medals explicitly mentioned for individual athletes:\n\n**Norway:** \n- Johannes Klaebo: 1 gold medal (from the relay event at these Games)\n- Total: **1 medal**\n\n**Italy:**\n- Federica Brignone: 1 gold medal (giant slalom)\n- Total: **1 medal**\n\n**Netherlands:**\n- Femke Kok: 1 medal (Olympic record performance mentioned)\n- Total: **1 medal**\n\n## Calculation:\nNorway = 1 medal\nItaly = 1 medal  \nNetherlands = 1 medal\n\n1 = 1 = 1 (tie)\n\n## Answer:\n\nBased on the individual athlete achievements article, **there is a three-way tie** between Norway, Italy, and the Netherlands, with each country having **1 medal** mentioned for their individual athletes (Klaebo, Brignone, and Kok respectively).\n\n**Important Note:** The question asks specifically about medals \"mentioned in the athlete achievements article,\" not the overall medal standings. While Norway leads the overall Games with 26 total medals (Fact 5, 7), the athlete achievements article only specifically names three individual athletes with one medal each.",
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The agent failed to identify Lisa Vittozzi as an Italian athlete mentioned in the article, which was critical to determining Italy as having 2 athletes (the most). The agent only counted 3 athletes with 1 medal each, resulting in an incorrect three-way tie conclusion instead of identifying Italy as the correct answer with 2 athletes mentioned. While the agent showed good analytical structure and correctly identified some athletes, missing a key athlete represents a significant gap in the multi-source synthesis required for this L2 question."

      "expected": "First Winter Olympics in Italy since 1956 (70-year gap) and Italy already exceeded their previous best gold medal count",
      "actual": "# What Makes the 2026 Olympics Historically Significant for Italy\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina are historically significant for Italy for **two major reasons**:\n\n## 1. **70-Year Gap Since Last Hosting**\n\nItaly is hosting the Winter Olympics for the first time in **70 years** - their last hosting was in 1956. This makes the 2026 Games a momentous return to the Olympic stage as host nation after seven decades.\n\n**Source:** Fact #4 states \"the 70-year gap since Italy last hosted in 1956\"\n\n## 2. **Record-Breaking Performance**\n\nItaly has achieved their **best-ever Winter Olympics performance** at these home Games, winning **8 gold medals** - surpassing their previous record of 5 gold medals from the 2006 Turin Games.\n\n**Sources:** \n- Fact #13: \"Italy has won 8 gold medals at the 2026 Winter Olympics\"\n- Fact #14: \"Italy's previous best Winter Olympics performance was 5 gold medals at the 2006 Turin Games\"\n\n## The Connection: Home Advantage Success\n\nThese two factors are interconnected - Italy's historic performance breakthrough appears to be fueled by the **home advantage** of hosting for the first time in 70 years. The facts show Italy is in **second place overall** with 22 total medals (Fact #8), trailing only Norway's dominant 26 medals.\n\nNotable Italian victories include:\n- **Federica Brignone** winning giant slalom gold in alpine skiing (Fact #17)\n- **Lisa Vittozzi** capturing biathlon pursuit gold with a \"stunning performance\" (Fact #18)\n\nThis combination of the long-awaited return as host nation and the record-breaking medal performance makes the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics a watershed moment in Italian Winter Olympics history.",

The agent provides comprehensive sourcing, accurate details, and even adds contextual information about specific athletes and overall medal standings that enhances the answer without detracting from the core requirements.
