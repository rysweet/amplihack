      "question": "How many people watched the 2026 opening ceremony?",

      "reasoning_type": "contradiction_detection",
      "expected": "There are conflicting reports: IOC estimates 1.2 billion viewers, while independent analysts report 800 million viewers",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, there are **two conflicting reports** about the 2026 opening ceremony viewership:\n\n## Answer 1: 1.2 billion viewers\nAccording to one source, **1.2 billion viewers worldwide** watched the 2026 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Milan. This source also states it was \"the most-watched Winter Olympics opening ceremony in history,\" breaking the previous record of 900 million viewers from the 2022 Beijing Olympics.\n\n## Answer 2: 800 million viewers\nHowever, another source reports that the 2026 Milan Olympics opening ceremony attracted **approximately 800 million viewers globally**. This same source notes this was actually a decline of 100 million viewers compared to the 2022 Beijing Olympics (900 million), and attributes the decrease to \"evolving media consumption patterns\" and shifts toward streaming platforms.\n\n## Conclusion\n**The facts contain contradictory information.** One source claims 1.2 billion viewers (a record increase), while another claims 800 million viewers (a decrease from 2022). Without additional information to clarify which source is more accurate or whether these numbers represent different measurement methodologies (e.g., traditional broadcast vs. total viewership including streaming), I cannot provide a definitive answer.\n\nTo resolve this discrepancy, we would need:\n- Clarification on the measurement methodology used by each source\n- Official IOC viewership data\n- Information about whether these numbers include or exclude streaming platforms",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Perfect L5 response. The agent correctly identifies both conflicting reports (1.2 billion from IOC vs 800 million from independent analysts), explicitly acknowledges the contradiction, presents both viewpoints clearly, and appropriately declines to resolve the conflict without additional information. The agent goes beyond the expected answer by providing contextual details about each claim and suggesting what would be needed to resolve the discrepancy, demonstrating excellent contradiction handling skills."

      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "contradiction_reasoning",
      "expected": "Different measurement methodologies (IOC preliminary data vs independent analysts), different counting methods (traditional TV only vs including streaming), or different time windows measured",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, **the two sources disagree significantly about the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony viewership numbers:**\n\n## The Conflicting Numbers:\n\n**Source 1:** Reports **1.2 billion viewers** worldwide, claiming it broke the previous 2022 Beijing record of 900 million viewers (Fact #2)\n\n**Source 2:** Reports **800 million viewers**, which represents a **decline** of 100 million from the 2022 Beijing Olympics' 900 million viewers (Fact #3)\n\n## Why They Might Disagree:\n\nBased on the information provided, here are the likely reasons for this discrepancy:\n\n1. **Different Measurement Methodologies**: The sources may be measuring viewership differently:\n   - One source might include **only traditional broadcasting** (TV viewership)\n   - The other might include **streaming platforms and digital viewing** in addition to traditional TV\n   - Source 1 notes the data is \"preliminary\" from the International Olympic Committee (Fact #19), suggesting it may still be subject to revision\n\n2. **Different Counting Periods**: They may be measuring different timeframes:\n   - Live viewership only vs. live + replay viewership\n   - Different geographic coverage or time windows\n\n3. **Evolving Media Landscape**: Fact #3 specifically mentions that Milan 2026 \"achieved record social media interactions despite lower conventional viewership numbers.\" This suggests:\n   - Source 2 (800 million) may be counting **traditional/conventional viewership only**\n   - Source 1 (1.2 billion) may be including **digital and social media engagement**\n\n## Which Source Might Be More Reliable?\n\n- Source 1 explicitly states its data comes from the **International Olympic Committee** and acknowledges it's **preliminary**\n- Source 2 provides context about **media consumption pattern shifts** and the digital transformation of audience engagement\n\n**Recommendation**: The discrepancy likely reflects whether digital/streaming viewership is included. Without knowing the exact methodology each source used, both could be accurate for what they're specifically measuring.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent excellently identifies the contradiction between the two sources (1.2B vs 800M viewers) and provides comprehensive reasons for the disagreement that fully align with the expected answer. The agent correctly identifies: (1) different measurement methodologies including IOC preliminary data vs other sources, (2) different counting methods (traditional TV vs including streaming/digital), and (3) implicitly different time windows. The agent goes beyond the expected answer by providing rich context about the evolving media landscape and explicitly acknowledges the contradiction without forcing a premature resolution. For L5 cognitive level, this demonstrates strong contradiction detection and reasoning."

      "question": "Which viewership figure would you consider more reliable and why?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "source_credibility",
      "expected": "Independent analysts (800M) may be more reliable because they explicitly mention methodology and account for fragmentation across platforms, while IOC figure is 'preliminary' and may have organizational bias toward reporting higher numbers",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, there are **conflicting viewership figures** for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony, and I need to present both:\n\n## The Two Conflicting Figures:\n\n**1. 1.2 billion viewers** (Fact #1)\n- Source: International Olympic Committee (preliminary data)\n- Claims this broke the previous 2022 Beijing record of 900 million\n\n**2. 800 million viewers** (Fact #3)\n- Source: Independent media analysts\n- Shows a decline from Beijing 2022's 900 million viewers\n\n## Which is More Reliable?\n\n**I would consider the 1.2 billion figure from the IOC more reliable**, for these reasons:\n\n1. **Official Source**: The International Olympic Committee is the governing body of the Olympics and has direct access to broadcasting data from all official rights holders worldwide.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Data Collection**: The IOC receives viewership reports from all licensed broadcasters across different platforms and regions, giving them the most complete picture.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Both sources agree Beijing 2022 had 900 million viewers, which serves as a reliable baseline. The IOC's claim of growth aligns with typical Olympic trends for host nations with strong cultural appeal.\n\n## Why the Discrepancy Exists:\n\nThe facts suggest these differences may stem from:\n- **Different measurement methodologies**: The IOC likely includes streaming platforms and digital viewing, while independent analysts may focus on traditional broadcasting (Fact #17 notes \"increased fragmentation across streaming platforms\")\n- **Timing of data collection**: The IOC data is noted as \"preliminary\" (Fact #10), suggesting it may be more current\n- **What's counted**: The 800 million figure may represent traditional TV only, while 1.2 billion includes all platforms\n\n**Recommendation**: Trust the IOC figure (1.2 billion) as the official record, while acknowledging that traditional broadcast viewership may have declined as suggested by the independent analysis.",
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the contradiction between the two figures (800M vs 1.2B), which is appropriate for L5. However, the agent reaches the opposite conclusion from the expected answer. The expected answer considers the 800M figure from independent analysts MORE reliable due to explicit methodology and noting IOC's 'preliminary' status plus potential organizational bias. The agent instead trusts the IOC figure despite acknowledging it's preliminary, and fails to recognize the organizational bias concern. The agent also inverts the reasoning about methodology - the expected answer values that independent analysts 'explicitly mention methodology,' but the agent assumes IOC has better methodology without evidence. While the agent demonstrates understanding of the contradiction, the fundamental reliability assessment is reversed from what was expected."
