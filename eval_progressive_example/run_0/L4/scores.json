      "actual": "# Answer: Creating a New Flutter Project\n\n## The Command\n\nTo create a new Flutter project, you use the command:\n\n```\nflutter create my_app\n```\n\n## How This Command Works\n\n**Basic Structure:**\n- `flutter create` is the base command that initiates project creation\n- `my_app` is the project name (you can replace this with any valid project name)\n\n**What This Command Does:**\n\nWhen you run `flutter create my_app`, Flutter will:\n\n1. **Generate a complete project structure** with all necessary files and folders\n2. **Create the main application file** at `lib/main.dart` where you'll write your code\n3. **Set up the pubspec.yaml file** where you'll manage dependencies\n4. **Configure platform-specific files** for Android, iOS, web, and other supported platforms\n\n## Practical Application in the Development Workflow\n\nThis command fits into the broader Flutter development workflow:\n\n1. **Installation & Verification**: First, ensure Flutter is properly installed using `flutter doctor`\n2. **Project Creation**: Run `flutter create my_app` to create your new project \u2190 *This is where we are*\n3. **Dependency Management**: Add dependencies to `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`\n4. **Development**: Edit code in `lib/main.dart`\n5. **Testing**: Use `flutter test` to run tests\n6. **Execution**: Run `flutter run` to launch your app on a device or emulator\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\n# Create a new Flutter project named \"my_awesome_app\"\nflutter create my_awesome_app\n\n# Navigate into the project directory\ncd my_awesome_app\n\n# Run the app\nflutter run\n```\n\nThis command is the essential starting point for any Flutter development project.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the command as 'flutter create my_app' (or with any valid project name), which matches the expected answer perfectly. While the agent provides extensive additional context about how the command works, what it does, and how it fits into the development workflow, this extra information does not detract from the core answer - it demonstrates deep understanding of the procedure (appropriate for L4 Procedural Learning). The command is factually accurate and properly presented with clear examples."

      "question": "What should you do if flutter doctor shows version conflicts?",
      "level": "L4",
      "reasoning_type": "procedural_troubleshooting",
      "expected": "Run 'flutter upgrade' first",
      "actual": "# Answer: What to Do If Flutter Doctor Shows Version Conflicts\n\n## The Solution\n\nIf `flutter doctor` shows version conflicts, you should run:\n\n```\nflutter upgrade\n```\n\n## How This Resolves the Issue\n\n**Direct Resolution:**\nAccording to Fact 4, \"Running 'flutter upgrade' resolves version conflicts.\" This command updates your Flutter SDK to the latest stable version, which typically resolves compatibility issues between:\n- Flutter SDK components\n- Dart SDK versions\n- Dependencies and packages\n- Platform-specific tools\n\n## Understanding the Context\n\n**Why Version Conflicts Occur:**\nVersion conflicts can arise when:\n- Your Flutter SDK is outdated compared to project requirements\n- Dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` require newer Flutter versions\n- Platform tools (Android SDK, Xcode) have been updated but Flutter hasn't\n\n**The Role of Flutter Doctor:**\nAccording to Fact 2, `flutter doctor` \"verifies Flutter installation and checks all dependencies.\" When it detects version mismatches, it will display warnings or errors indicating which components are incompatible.\n\n## Complete Troubleshooting Workflow\n\nBased on the facts provided, here's the recommended approach:\n\n1. **Run flutter doctor** to identify the version conflicts\n2. **Execute `flutter upgrade`** to update Flutter SDK\n3. **Run flutter doctor again** to verify the conflicts are resolved\n4. **If issues persist**, consider:\n   - Updating Android Studio (Fact 3) for Android SDK issues\n   - Running `flutter pub cache repair` (Fact 10) for package-related problems\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter running `flutter upgrade`, the version conflicts should be resolved, and `flutter doctor` should show green checkmarks for all components, confirming your development environment is properly configured.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is comprehensive and correctly identifies the core solution: run 'flutter upgrade' to resolve version conflicts. This matches the expected answer perfectly. The agent goes beyond the minimum by providing proper context (citing Fact 4 for the direct solution and Fact 2 for flutter doctor's purpose), explaining why conflicts occur, and offering a complete troubleshooting workflow. While more detailed than the expected answer, the agent directly and prominently states the correct procedure at the beginning, demonstrating proper L4 (Procedural Learning) understanding. The additional context enhances rather than detracts from the answer."

      "score": 0.45,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the initial step (flutter create my_app) and mentions key components like lib/main.dart and pubspec.yaml. However, it fails to provide the specific procedural steps required for L4 evaluation: missing 'cd my_app', 'edit lib/main.dart', 'add dependencies to pubspec.yaml', 'flutter pub get', and 'flutter test' commands. The answer is verbose with unnecessary prerequisites and troubleshooting sections that aren't part of the workflow. While the agent acknowledges limitations in the facts, a procedural learning task requires executing the specific step-by-step commands, which are largely absent or incomplete."

      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies all three main commands (flutter create weather_app, cd weather_app, and adding the http package). The primary difference is in Step 3: the agent recommends 'flutter pub add http' which is a modern, valid approach that automatically updates pubspec.yaml and runs pub get. The expected answer requires manual editing of pubspec.yaml followed by 'flutter pub get'. Both methods achieve the same result, and the agent even acknowledges the alternative manual approach. The agent demonstrates proper procedural understanding with clear explanations. Minor deduction because the expected answer specifies the manual method with version ^1.0.0, while the agent prioritizes the automated command, though both are correct."
