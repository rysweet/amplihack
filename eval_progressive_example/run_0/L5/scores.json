      "question": "How many people watched the 2026 opening ceremony?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "contradiction_detection",
      "expected": "There are conflicting reports: IOC estimates 1.2 billion viewers, while independent analysts report 800 million viewers",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, there are **conflicting reports** about the viewership for the 2026 opening ceremony:\n\n**Two different figures are given:**\n\n1. **1.2 billion viewers** - According to facts #3 and #4, the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony was watched by an estimated 1.2 billion viewers worldwide, with preliminary figures provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This source also states it was the most-watched Winter Olympics opening ceremony in history, surpassing the previous record of 900 million from Beijing 2022.\n\n2. **800 million viewers** - According to facts #2 and #14, the 2026 Milan Olympics opening ceremony attracted approximately 800 million viewers globally, representing a decline of about 100 million viewers from the 2022 Beijing Olympics (which had 900 million viewers).\n\n**The discrepancy:**\nThese facts directly contradict each other - one source claims viewership increased to a record 1.2 billion, while another claims it decreased to 800 million.\n\nWithout additional context to determine which source is more reliable or whether these figures represent different measurement methodologies (e.g., traditional TV vs. total including streaming), I cannot provide a definitive answer. The actual viewership was either **1.2 billion** or **800 million** people, depending on which source is accurate.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Perfect L5 response. The agent correctly identifies the contradiction between the two viewership figures (1.2 billion vs 800 million), provides detailed source attribution for each conflicting report (IOC vs independent analysts implied), and explicitly acknowledges the discrepancy without incorrectly choosing one over the other. The answer goes beyond the expected answer by providing helpful context about the conflicting claims (record increase vs decline from 900M). For L5 Contradiction Handling, full points are awarded when the agent acknowledges the contradiction, which this answer does comprehensively."

      "question": "Why might the two sources disagree about viewership numbers?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "contradiction_reasoning",
      "expected": "Different measurement methodologies (IOC preliminary data vs independent analysts), different counting methods (traditional TV only vs including streaming), or different time windows measured",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, the two sources disagree about the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony viewership numbers for the following reasons:\n\n## The Disagreement\n\n**Source 1 (IOC data):** Reports 1.2 billion viewers, claiming it surpassed the previous record of 900 million from Beijing 2022.\n\n**Source 2 (Independent media analysts):** Reports 800 million viewers, showing a decline from 900 million at Beijing 2022.\n\n## Why They Might Differ\n\n1. **Different Data Sources**: \n   - The first figure comes from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has a vested interest in reporting positive viewership numbers\n   - The second comes from independent media analysts, who may use different measurement methodologies\n\n2. **Different Measurement Methods**:\n   - The sources may be counting viewership differently (e.g., unique viewers vs. total views, live vs. delayed viewing, traditional TV only vs. including streaming platforms)\n   - One may include digital/streaming platforms while the other focuses on traditional broadcast\n\n3. **Preliminary vs. Final Data**:\n   - The IOC data is explicitly noted as \"preliminary,\" meaning it could be an estimate that may be revised\n   - The independent analysts' data may represent more verified or conservative figures\n\n4. **Timing of Data Collection**:\n   - The data may have been compiled at different points, capturing different viewing windows\n\n## Which Might Be More Reliable?\n\nThe independent media analysts' figure of 800 million may be more conservative and potentially more reliable, as independent sources typically have less incentive to inflate numbers. However, the IOC has access to official broadcaster data that independent analysts might not. The fact that the IOC data is labeled \"preliminary\" suggests it should be treated with some caution until confirmed.",
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The agent provides an excellent L5 response that clearly identifies the contradiction and offers comprehensive reasons for the disagreement. It covers all key points from the expected answer: different measurement methodologies (IOC vs independent analysts), different counting methods (traditional TV vs streaming), and timing differences (preliminary vs final data). The agent goes beyond by adding context about data reliability and vested interests. The additional analysis, while not required, demonstrates strong contradiction handling. Minor deduction only because the response is somewhat verbose for what was asked, but all core elements are present and well-explained."

      "question": "Which viewership figure would you consider more reliable and why?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "source_credibility",
      "expected": "Independent analysts (800M) may be more reliable because they explicitly mention methodology and account for fragmentation across platforms, while IOC figure is 'preliminary' and may have organizational bias toward reporting higher numbers",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, there are **conflicting viewership figures** for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony:\n\n## The Two Figures:\n\n1. **1.2 billion viewers** - Reported as a record, surpassing Beijing 2022's 900 million\n   - Source: International Olympic Committee (IOC) - preliminary data\n\n2. **800 million viewers** - Reported as a decline from Beijing 2022's 900 million\n   - Source: Independent media analysts\n\n## Which is More Reliable?\n\n**The 800 million figure from independent media analysts appears more reliable** for these reasons:\n\n1. **Independence**: Independent analysts are typically more objective than the IOC, which has a vested interest in reporting positive viewership numbers to sponsors and stakeholders.\n\n2. **Contextual consistency**: The 800 million figure aligns with documented trends of declining traditional TV viewership and fragmentation across streaming platforms. The explanation provided (changing viewing habits, streaming fragmentation) is more credible than a sudden 33% increase.\n\n3. **Preliminary vs. analyzed data**: The IOC figure is explicitly labeled as \"preliminary,\" suggesting it may not be fully verified, while the independent analysts' data appears to be a compiled analysis.\n\n4. **Social media context**: The independent analysis notes that while TV viewership declined, social media interactions reached record levels - this nuanced picture is more realistic than simple record-breaking claims.\n\nHowever, both sources have merit, and the true figure may depend on what's being measured (traditional TV only vs. all platforms, global vs. specific regions, live vs. delayed viewing).",
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The agent excellently identifies the contradiction between the two viewership figures and provides a well-reasoned analysis favoring the independent analysts' 800M figure. All key points from the expected answer are covered: methodology transparency, the 'preliminary' nature of IOC data, and organizational bias. The agent goes beyond the expected answer by adding valid supporting points about contextual consistency with viewing trends and the nuanced social media context. The only minor gap is that 'fragmentation across platforms' could have been emphasized more explicitly as a methodological consideration, though it is mentioned in the contextual consistency section. This is an exemplary L5 response that clearly handles the contradiction."
