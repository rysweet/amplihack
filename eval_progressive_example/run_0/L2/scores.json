      "actual": "# Answer: Italy's 2026 Gold Medal Performance vs. Previous Best\n\n## Temporal Organization of Facts\n\n**Italy's Historical Performance:**\n- **2006 Turin Winter Olympics**: 5 gold medals (previous best)\n- **2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics**: 8 gold medals (as of February 15, 2026)\n\n## Comparison and Calculation\n\nItaly's 2026 performance compared to their previous best:\n\n**Difference: 8 gold medals (2026) - 5 gold medals (2006) = +3 gold medals**\n\n## Reasoning\n\nBased on the provided facts:\n\n1. **Previous Best**: Italy's previous best Winter Olympics performance was 5 gold medals at the 2006 Turin Games (Fact 14)\n\n2. **2026 Performance**: Italy has won 8 gold medals at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics (Facts 3, 8, 13)\n\n3. **Direct Comparison**: Fact 15 explicitly states that \"Italy's 8 gold medals at Milan-Cortina 2026 surpasses their previous best of 5 gold medals from Turin 2006\"\n\n4. **Improvement**: Italy gained 3 additional gold medals compared to their previous best, representing a 60% increase over their 2006 performance (3/5 = 0.60)\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- This achievement is particularly notable as it occurs on home soil, with a 70-year gap since Italy last hosted the Winter Olympics in Cortina in 1956 (Fact 12)\n- As of February 15, 2026, Italy ranked second overall in the medal standings with 22 total medals (Fact 8)\n\n**Note**: The data is from February 15, 2026, during the ongoing Olympics (which run through February 21), so Italy's final gold medal count could potentially be higher.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is comprehensive and exceeds expectations. It correctly identifies Italy's 8 golds in 2026 and compares it to their previous best of 5 golds from 2006 Turin, which matches the expected answer exactly. The agent goes beyond the minimum by: (1) calculating the difference (+3 medals), (2) computing the percentage increase (60%), (3) providing proper temporal organization, (4) adding relevant context about home soil advantage, and (5) noting that data is from an ongoing event. All core facts are accurate and directly address the L3 temporal reasoning requirement of comparing performances across time."

      "actual": "I need to analyze which country's individual athletes won the most medals mentioned in the athlete achievements article.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the individual athlete achievements mentioned\n\nFrom the facts, the specific individual athlete achievements mentioned are:\n\n1. **Johannes Klaebo (Norway)** - Won his 9th career Olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing relay\n2. **Federica Brignone (Italy)** - Won giant slalom gold in alpine skiing\n3. **Lisa Vittozzi (Italy)** - Won biathlon pursuit gold medal\n4. **Femke Kok (Netherlands)** - Set Olympic record in 500m speed skating (won gold)\n\n## Step 2: Count medals by country\n\nLet me count the medals mentioned for each country's individual athletes:\n\n- **Norway**: 1 medal (Klaebo's gold)\n- **Italy**: 2 medals (Brignone's gold + Vittozzi's gold)\n- **Netherlands**: 1 medal (Kok's gold)\n\n## Step 3: Verify the calculation\n\nNorway medals: 1\nItaly medals: 1 + 1 = 2\nNetherlands medals: 1\n\nTotal medals mentioned: 1 + 2 + 1 = 3 \u2713\n\n## Answer\n\n**Italy's individual athletes won the most medals mentioned in the athlete achievements article, with 2 medals.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe athlete achievements article specifically highlighted four individual performances:\n- Italy had 2 gold medals (Federica Brignone in alpine skiing giant slalom and Lisa Vittozzi in biathlon pursuit)\n- Norway had 1 gold medal (Johannes Klaebo in cross-country skiing relay)\n- Netherlands had 1 gold medal (Femke Kok in 500m speed skating)\n\nTherefore, Italy's individual athletes won the most medals (2) among those specifically mentioned in the individual athlete achievements content.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is comprehensive and accurate. It correctly identifies Italy as the country with the most individual athlete medal winners mentioned (2 athletes: Federica Brignone and Lisa Vittozzi), provides detailed step-by-step analysis showing the medal count for each country (Norway: 1, Italy: 2, Netherlands: 1), and arrives at the correct conclusion. The answer goes beyond the expected response by showing all the work and verification, which demonstrates proper L2 Multi-Source Synthesis reasoning. The core answer matches the expected answer perfectly."

      "question": "What makes the 2026 Olympics historically significant for Italy?",
      "level": "L2",
      "reasoning_type": "cross_source_synthesis",
      "expected": "First Winter Olympics in Italy since 1956 (70-year gap) and Italy already exceeded their previous best gold medal count",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, the 2026 Olympics are historically significant for Italy for two key reasons:\n\n## Historical Significance:\n\n**1. First Winter Olympics in Italy in 70 Years**\nThe Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics mark Italy's first time hosting the Winter Games since 1956 - a gap of 70 years. This makes it a momentous occasion for the country to once again welcome the world's winter sports athletes.\n\n**2. Record-Breaking Performance**\nItaly has achieved their best-ever Winter Olympics performance at these Games, winning **8 gold medals** - breaking their previous record of 5 gold medals set at the 2006 Turin Games. This represents a 60% improvement over their previous best.\n\n## Supporting Evidence:\n\nThe exceptional performance appears to be driven by home-field advantage, with Italian athletes winning gold medals across multiple disciplines including:\n- Federica Brignone winning giant slalom gold in alpine skiing\n- Lisa Vittozzi capturing biathlon pursuit gold\n\nAs of February 15, 2026, Italy sits in **second place overall** with 22 total medals (8 gold, and the remaining silver and bronze), trailing only Norway's 26 medals - an impressive showing for the host nation.\n\n## Reasoning:\n\nThe combination of (1) the long 70-year wait to host again and (2) achieving unprecedented success with a record-breaking medal haul makes the 2026 Olympics a historic milestone in Italy's Winter Olympic history. The home advantage appears to have inspired Italian athletes to their greatest Winter Games performance ever.",
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the 70-year gap since Italy last hosted (1956), which is one key point. However, it makes a critical error in the second point: the expected answer states Italy 'already exceeded their previous best gold medal count' (implying this happened before the 2026 games concluded), while the agent presents the 8 gold medals as the final achievement 'at these Games.' The agent also adds excessive supporting detail not required by the question (specific athletes, medal standings, home advantage speculation) which, while not incorrect, goes beyond the core historical significance. The core L2 synthesis task required combining two facts: the hosting gap and the record-breaking performance, but the temporal framing is confused."
