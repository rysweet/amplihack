      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is perfect. It correctly identifies the medal counts on Day 7 (18 medals) and Day 9 (26 medals), performs the correct calculation (26 - 18 = 8), and arrives at the exact expected answer of 8 medals. The agent demonstrates strong L3 (Temporal Reasoning) skills by organizing facts by time period, computing the difference accurately, and even verifying the calculation. The additional breakdown of gold medals shows thoroughness without introducing errors. The answer matches the expected answer both numerically and semantically."

      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies Norway's improvement of +5 golds (8 to 13) and provides accurate calculation. However, it claims Day 10 data is not explicitly available for Italy and US, when the expected answer shows Italy at 9 golds (+4) and US at 6 golds (+2) for Day 10. The agent provides a partial answer with correct methodology but fails to find or use all the relevant data needed for a complete comparison, missing that Italy had the second-best improvement and US had the third-best."

      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies Italy had 8 golds on both Day 9 and Day 10 (no change), but completely misses the critical information needed for L3 temporal reasoning. The expected answer shows Italy gained +3 golds from Day 7-9 and +1 gold from Day 9-10, demonstrating an 'acceleration' trend with 4 total golds gained. The agent claims Day 7 data is unavailable, suggesting either the facts did contain this information (making the agent's answer incorrect for missing it) or the question itself was flawed. However, given the expected answer clearly references Day 7-9 changes, the agent failed to extract or synthesize the necessary temporal information to describe the three-day trend of gaining 4 golds with changing momentum. The agent provides relevant context but misses the core temporal reasoning task."
