      "question": "What makes the 2026 Olympics historically significant for Italy?",
      "level": "L2",
      "reasoning_type": "cross_source_synthesis",
      "expected": "First Winter Olympics in Italy since 1956 (70-year gap) and Italy already exceeded their previous best gold medal count",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, the 2026 Olympics are historically significant for Italy for several interconnected reasons:\n\n## Historical Significance for Italy:\n\n**1. Return to Hosting After 70 Years**\nItaly is hosting the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina in 2026, marking a 70-year gap since they last hosted in 1956 (Fact 3). This makes it a momentous return to the Olympic stage as a host nation.\n\n**2. Record-Breaking Performance**\nItaly has achieved their best-ever Winter Olympics performance with **8 gold medals** at the 2026 Games (Facts 12, 13). This surpasses their previous record of 5 gold medals from the 2006 Turin Games, representing a 60% improvement over their prior best.\n\n**3. Strong Overall Medal Count**\nAs of February 15, 2026, Italy sits in **second place** in the overall medal standings with 22 total medals (Fact 7), demonstrating exceptional performance as the host nation.\n\n**4. Home Success Stories**\nItalian athletes are excelling on home soil, including:\n- Federica Brignone winning giant slalom gold (Fact 19)\n- Lisa Vittozzi capturing biathlon pursuit gold (Fact 20)\n\n## Reasoning:\n\nThe combination of these factors makes 2026 historically significant: Italy is not only returning as a host after seven decades, but they're also achieving their best-ever performance at a Winter Olympics. The 8 gold medals represent a new benchmark for Italian winter sports, and doing so at home makes it even more meaningful. This convergence of hosting duties and record-breaking athletic achievement creates a landmark moment in Italy's Olympic history.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer correctly identifies both key historically significant elements: (1) Italy hosting the Winter Olympics for the first time since 1956, marking a 70-year gap, and (2) Italy achieving a record-breaking 8 gold medals, exceeding their previous best of 5 from 2006. The answer synthesizes multiple facts appropriately for this L2 cognitive level task, providing comprehensive context including the overall medal standing and specific athlete achievements. The answer is well-structured and accurately captures what makes these Olympics historically significant for Italy."
