It correctly identifies that Klaebo's record increased from 9 to 10 gold medals between February 15 and February 17, and accurately attributes the 10th gold to winning the individual sprint on February 17. The agent provides additional relevant context (the 2.3-second margin, team relay for the 9th gold) that enhances the answer without contradicting the core facts. This demonstrates proper L6 (Incremental Learning) by tracking the knowledge update across the two dates."

The answer demonstrates strong L6 incremental learning by tracking the sequential updates to Klaebo's record. The additional context and organization enhance rather than detract from the answer, and the agent appropriately notes limitations in the available data regarding medal distribution across earlier Olympics."
