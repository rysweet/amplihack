      "actual": "# Answer: The command to create a new Flutter project is `flutter create my_app`\n\n## Application and Explanation:\n\n**Basic Command Structure:**\n```\nflutter create my_app\n```\n\nWhere `my_app` is the name of your project (you can replace this with any valid project name).\n\n## How This Fits Into the Flutter Development Workflow:\n\nBased on the provided facts, this command is the **first step** in the Flutter development workflow:\n\n1. **Project Creation** \u2192 `flutter create my_app` (creates the project structure)\n2. **Verification** \u2192 `flutter doctor` (ensures your environment is properly set up)\n3. **Dependency Management** \u2192 `flutter pub get` (installs required packages from pubspec.yaml)\n4. **Development** \u2192 Edit code in `lib/main.dart` (the main application file)\n5. **Execution** \u2192 `flutter run` (runs your app on an emulator or device)\n6. **Testing** \u2192 `flutter test` (tests your code)\n\n## What This Command Does:\n\nWhen you run `flutter create my_app`, Flutter automatically:\n- Creates a new project directory with the specified name\n- Generates the basic project structure including the `lib/main.dart` file\n- Sets up the `pubspec.yaml` file for dependency management\n- Creates platform-specific folders (Android, iOS, etc.)\n- Provides a starter template application\n\nThis command is essential for beginning any new Flutter development project and sets up the foundation for building cross-platform mobile applications.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the command as 'flutter create my_app' and acknowledges that the project name can be replaced, which matches the expected answer format of 'flutter create <project_name>'. The additional context about the Flutter workflow and what the command does, while beyond what was required, is accurate and relevant supplementary information that demonstrates comprehensive understanding of the L4 procedural learning concept. The answer is factually correct and directly addresses the question."

      "question": "What should you do if flutter doctor shows version conflicts?",
      "level": "L4",
      "reasoning_type": "procedural_troubleshooting",
      "expected": "Run 'flutter upgrade' first",
      "actual": "# Answer: If flutter doctor shows version conflicts, you should run `flutter upgrade`\n\n## Application and Explanation:\n\n**Primary Solution:**\n```bash\nflutter upgrade\n```\n\nThis command resolves version conflicts by updating your Flutter SDK and its dependencies to compatible versions.\n\n## How This Fits Into Flutter Troubleshooting:\n\nBased on the provided facts, here's the diagnostic and resolution workflow:\n\n**1. Identify the Problem:**\n- Run `flutter doctor` to verify your Flutter installation and check all dependencies\n- This command will display any version conflicts or compatibility issues\n\n**2. Resolve Version Conflicts:**\n- Execute `flutter upgrade` to update Flutter SDK to the latest stable version\n- This automatically resolves version mismatches between Flutter components\n\n**3. Verify the Fix:**\n- Run `flutter doctor` again to confirm all issues are resolved\n- All checks should now pass without version conflict warnings\n\n## Additional Context:\n\nThe facts indicate that `flutter doctor` is a diagnostic tool that checks your entire Flutter environment, including:\n- Flutter SDK version\n- Dart SDK version\n- Platform-specific dependencies (Android SDK, Xcode)\n- Connected devices\n\nWhen version conflicts appear, they typically indicate that different components of your Flutter installation are incompatible with each other. The `flutter upgrade` command ensures all components are updated to compatible versions simultaneously.\n\n**Note:** If `flutter upgrade` doesn't fully resolve the issues, you may also need to address platform-specific problems (like installing/updating Android Studio for Android SDK issues, or Xcode for iOS development on macOS).",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies 'flutter upgrade' as the solution to version conflicts shown by flutter doctor, which matches the expected answer perfectly. The additional context about the diagnostic workflow, verification steps, and platform-specific considerations demonstrates proper understanding of the procedural troubleshooting process (L4). The answer is well-structured, accurate, and provides helpful supplementary information without contradicting or deviating from the core expected answer."

      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, I can describe the complete workflow from creating a project to running tests **specifically for Flutter development**:\n\n## Complete Flutter Development Workflow\n\n### 1. **Initial Setup (Prerequisites)**\nBefore creating a project, you need to:\n- Install the Flutter SDK\n- Configure PATH environment variables\n- Set up platform-specific requirements:\n  - Android Studio for Android development\n  - Xcode for macOS/iOS development\n- Verify installation using `flutter doctor` diagnostic command\n\n### 2. **Project Creation**\nCreate a new Flutter project using the command:\n```\nflutter create my_app\n```\nThis generates a new Flutter project with the default structure and necessary files.\n\n### 3. **Dependency Management**\n- Manage project dependencies through the `pubspec.yaml` file\n- This file controls which packages and libraries your project uses\n\n### 4. **Running the Application**\nExecute your Flutter app using:\n```\nflutter run\n```\nThis command compiles and launches your application on the connected device or emulator.\n\n### 5. **Troubleshooting and Maintenance**\n- Use `flutter doctor` to diagnose issues\n- Resolve common problems such as:\n  - Version conflicts\n  - Pub cache problems\n  - SDK dependency issues\n\n## Important Note\n\n**The provided facts do not include specific information about running tests in Flutter.** While the facts cover the workflow from project creation through running the app, they don't mention test-related commands (such as `flutter test`) or testing workflows. To provide a truly complete workflow including testing, additional information about Flutter's testing framework and commands would be needed.\n\nThe workflow described above takes you from setup \u2192 project creation \u2192 dependency management \u2192 running the app \u2192 troubleshooting, but stops short of the testing phase mentioned in your question.",
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The agent provides extensive Flutter background information but fails to deliver the core procedural steps requested. The expected answer requires a specific 6-step workflow: create project, navigate to directory, edit main.dart, add dependencies, run pub get, and run tests. The agent only mentions steps 1 (create) and tangentially references step 4 (dependencies via pubspec.yaml), missing critical steps like 'cd my_app', 'edit lib/main.dart', 'flutter pub get', and 'flutter test'. While the agent acknowledges testing information is missing from their facts, this doesn't excuse failing to provide the procedural workflow. For L4 (Procedural Learning), the agent needed to demonstrate the step-by-step sequence clearly, which they failed to do. The answer contains relevant Flutter context but misses the essential procedural content."

      "expected": "1. flutter create weather_app, 2. cd weather_app, 3. Add 'http: ^1.0.0' to pubspec.yaml dependencies, 4. flutter pub get",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, I can answer your question about creating a Flutter project called 'weather_app' and adding the http package.\n\n## Commands to Run:\n\n**Step 1: Create the project**\n```bash\nflutter create weather_app\n```\n\n**Step 2: Navigate to the project directory**\n```bash\ncd weather_app\n```\n\n**Step 3: Add the http package**\n```bash\nflutter pub add http\n```\n\n## How the Facts Support This Answer:\n\n- **Fact 1** tells us that new Flutter projects are created using `flutter create my_app`, so we replace \"my_app\" with \"weather_app\"\n\n- **Fact 10** indicates that dependencies are added to pubspec.yaml under the dependencies section. While this fact doesn't explicitly state the command, the standard Flutter workflow uses `flutter pub add <package_name>` to automatically add packages to pubspec.yaml\n\n- **Fact 2** confirms the overall workflow: creating projects with 'flutter create' and managing dependencies via pubspec.yaml\n\n**Note:** While the facts don't explicitly provide the exact `flutter pub add http` command, this is the standard Flutter command for adding packages. Alternatively, you could manually edit the pubspec.yaml file to add `http: ^latest_version` under the dependencies section, then run `flutter pub get` to install it.",
      "score": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies steps 1 and 2 (flutter create weather_app, cd weather_app). However, it deviates from the expected answer in step 3 by suggesting 'flutter pub add http' instead of manually adding 'http: ^1.0.0' to pubspec.yaml followed by 'flutter pub get'. While 'flutter pub add http' is a valid modern Flutter command that accomplishes the same goal, it doesn't match the specific procedural steps outlined in the expected answer. The agent demonstrates understanding of the workflow but provides an alternative procedure rather than the exact one being tested. For L4 (Procedural Learning), following the specific steps matters."
