      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is perfect. It correctly identifies that Norway won 8 medals between Day 7 and Day 9 (from 18 to 26 total medals), which matches the expected answer exactly. The response demonstrates strong L3 (Temporal Reasoning) skills by properly identifying the relevant time points, performing the correct calculation (26-18=8), and providing verification. The additional breakdown of gold medals (4 gold gained) adds helpful context without detracting from the core answer. The work is clearly organized and mathematically accurate."

      "score": 0.4,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies Norway's +5 improvement (8 to 13) and correctly states Norway improved the most. However, the agent fails to provide complete data for Italy and US at Day 10, claiming this information was 'not explicitly stated.' According to the expected answer, Italy went from 5 to 9 golds (+4) and US from 4 to 6 (+2) by Day 10. The agent only calculated through Day 9 for these countries, showing Italy at +3 and US at +1, which are incomplete calculations. While the final answer about Norway is correct, the supporting analysis is significantly incomplete, missing the full comparative context that Italy's +4 was the second-best improvement."

I have:\n\n- **Day 7 (February 13)**: Gold medal count not specified\n- **Day 9 (February 15)**: **8 gold medals** (clearly stated)\n- **Day 10 (February 16)**: Gold medal count not specified in the summary\n\n## What I Can Confirm:\n\nFrom the available data, I can only confirm that as of February 15 (Day 9), Italy had accumulated 8 gold medals, which represented their best-ever Winter Olympics performance, surpassing their previous record of 5 gold medals from the 2006 Turin Games (Facts 10, 11, 12).\n\n**Conclusion:** The facts provided do not contain sufficient detail to describe the trend in Italy's gold medal performance over the three specific days mentioned.

      "score": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent failed to extract the necessary data from the facts. The expected answer shows Italy gained +3 golds Day 7-9, then +1 gold Day 9-10 (4 golds total), indicating the data was available. The agent confirmed having Day 9 data (8 golds) but claimed Day 7 and Day 10 data were not specified. This is an L3 (Temporal Reasoning) question requiring computation of changes over time. The agent's inability to identify and extract the medal counts from the facts, and consequently failing to compute the trend or differences, results in no useful answer to the question posed."
