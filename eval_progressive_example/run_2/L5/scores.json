      "question": "How many people watched the 2026 opening ceremony?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "contradiction_detection",
      "expected": "There are conflicting reports: IOC estimates 1.2 billion viewers, while independent analysts report 800 million viewers",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, there are **conflicting reports** about the viewership for the 2026 Winter Olympics opening ceremony:\n\n**Two different figures are given:**\n\n1. **1.2 billion viewers** (Facts #3, #10, #11) - This source claims it was \"the most-watched Winter Olympics opening ceremony in history,\" surpassing Beijing 2022's 900 million viewers.\n\n2. **800 million viewers** (Facts #12, #13, #14) - This source indicates approximately 800 million viewers globally, representing a decline of about 100 million from Beijing 2022's 900 million viewers.\n\n**The contradiction:**\nThese facts directly conflict with each other. One set of sources claims viewership increased by 300 million (from 900M to 1.2B), while another claims it decreased by 100 million (from 900M to 800M).\n\n**Additional context from the facts:**\n- Both sources agree the ceremony was held in Milan (Facts #5, #11, #14)\n- The lower viewership figure (800M) is explained by fragmented streaming platforms and changing viewing habits, though it notes record social media engagement (Facts #6, #14)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWithout being able to verify which source is more reliable, I cannot provide a definitive answer. The viewership was either approximately **800 million** or **1.2 billion** viewers, depending on which data source is accurate.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Perfect L5 response. The agent clearly identifies both conflicting figures (1.2 billion vs 800 million), explains the nature of the contradiction with supporting details, and appropriately declines to choose between them without additional verification. The answer goes beyond the expected response by providing context about the sources and explaining the discrepancies. This demonstrates excellent contradiction handling."

      "question": "Why might the two sources disagree about viewership numbers?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "contradiction_reasoning",
      "expected": "Different measurement methodologies (IOC preliminary data vs independent analysts), different counting methods (traditional TV only vs including streaming), or different time windows measured",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, **the two sources disagree about the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony viewership numbers:**\n\n**Source 1 (International Olympic Committee):** 1.2 billion viewers worldwide\n**Source 2 (Independent media analysts):** 800 million viewers\n\n## Why They Might Disagree:\n\n**1. Different Measurement Methodologies:**\n- The IOC's preliminary figures (1.2 billion) may use broader counting methods that include all forms of viewership\n- Independent media analysts (800 million) may use more conservative measurement criteria or focus primarily on traditional television viewership\n\n**2. Data Collection Scope:**\n- The IOC might count global reach including streaming platforms, social media views, and partial viewership\n- Independent analysts may only count full, verified television audiences or use different regional data sources\n\n**3. Timing of Data:**\n- Both are described as preliminary, but they may have been compiled at different points after the ceremony with varying amounts of data available\n\n**4. Institutional Bias:**\n- The IOC has an interest in reporting higher numbers to demonstrate the Olympics' success and value to sponsors\n- Independent analysts may apply more rigorous verification standards\n\n## Which Source Might Be More Reliable?\n\nThe independent media analysts' figure (800 million) may be more conservative and verifiable, especially since the facts note that despite lower TV viewership compared to Beijing 2022 (900 million), the Milan ceremony achieved record social media interactions. This suggests the 800 million figure aligns better with the trend of declining traditional viewership, while the IOC's 1.2 billion may include these alternative digital engagement metrics.",
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The agent excellently identifies the contradiction and provides comprehensive reasoning that covers all expected points: different measurement methodologies (IOC vs independent analysts), different counting methods (streaming vs traditional TV), and implicit timing differences. The agent goes beyond the expected answer by discussing institutional bias and providing analysis of which source might be more reliable. The core L5 requirement of detecting and reasoning about conflicting information is fully met. Minor deduction only because the expected answer explicitly mentions 'different time windows measured' which the agent addresses less directly as 'timing of data' under point 3."

      "question": "Which viewership figure would you consider more reliable and why?",
      "level": "L5",
      "reasoning_type": "source_credibility",
      "expected": "Independent analysts (800M) may be more reliable because they explicitly mention methodology and account for fragmentation across platforms, while IOC figure is 'preliminary' and may have organizational bias toward reporting higher numbers",
      "actual": "Based on the provided facts, there are **two conflicting viewership figures** for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics opening ceremony:\n\n## The Two Figures:\n\n1. **1.2 billion viewers** - Source: International Olympic Committee's preliminary figures\n2. **800 million viewers** - Source: Independent media analysts\n\n## Which is More Reliable?\n\n**The 800 million figure from independent media analysts is likely more reliable**, for these reasons:\n\n### Why the 800 million figure seems more credible:\n\n1. **Independent verification**: Independent media analysts typically use rigorous, third-party methodology without organizational bias\n\n2. **Consistent with historical trends**: This figure shows a decline from Beijing 2022's 900 million viewers, which aligns with documented trends in media fragmentation and changing viewing habits\n\n3. **Accompanied by context**: The analysis explaining the 100 million viewer decline includes reasonable explanations (streaming platform fragmentation, evolving consumption patterns, shift to social media engagement)\n\n### Concerns about the 1.2 billion figure:\n\n1. **Labeled as \"preliminary\"**: The IOC data is explicitly noted as preliminary, suggesting it may not be final or fully verified\n\n2. **Potential organizational bias**: The IOC has institutional incentives to report higher viewership numbers\n\n3. **Contradicts trends**: A 33% increase over Beijing 2022 would be unusual given documented shifts away from traditional TV viewing\n\n## Recommendation:\n\nI would consider the **800 million viewer figure more reliable** until the IOC releases final, audited viewership data. However, both sources should be noted when discussing the event, as the true figure may require reconciliation of different measurement methodologies.",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer fully addresses the L5 contradiction handling task by: (1) explicitly identifying both conflicting figures (1.2B vs 800M), (2) choosing the more reliable source (independent analysts at 800M) with sound reasoning matching the expected answer, (3) explaining methodology concerns and organizational bias for the IOC figure being 'preliminary', and (4) noting the independent analysts' transparent methodology accounting for platform fragmentation. The agent goes beyond the expected answer by providing additional context about historical trends and making a clear recommendation while acknowledging both sources should be noted. This demonstrates excellent contradiction detection and reasoning."
