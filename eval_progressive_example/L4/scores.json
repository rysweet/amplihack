You would replace it with your actual project name, for example:\n- `flutter create todo_app`\n- `flutter create weather_dashboard`\n- `flutter create my_first_flutter_project`\n\nThis command will create a new directory with your project name containing all the necessary Flutter project structure and files, including the main application code in `lib/main.dart` (Fact 13).",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the command as 'flutter create my_app' and explicitly notes that 'my_app' is a placeholder that can be replaced with any project name, which aligns perfectly with the expected answer 'flutter create <project_name>'. The core answer is accurate and complete. While the agent provides extensive additional context about related Flutter commands and workflow, this supplementary information does not detract from the correctness of the primary answer - it simply provides helpful context that demonstrates understanding of the command's role in Flutter development."

      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies the primary solution 'Run flutter upgrade first' which matches the expected answer exactly. The response goes beyond the minimum requirement by providing proper context, step-by-step guidance, and additional troubleshooting information, all while clearly highlighting the core answer. The agent also appropriately cites sources and acknowledges limitations of the provided information. For L4 (Procedural Learning), the agent demonstrates understanding of the troubleshooting procedure and presents it in a clear, actionable format."

      "reasoning": "This is an L4 (Procedural Learning) question requiring the agent to provide a step-by-step workflow. The expected answer contains 6 specific sequential steps. The agent's answer completely fails to provide this workflow, instead spending extensive effort explaining what information is missing from the facts. While the agent correctly identifies that `flutter create my_app` is step 1, they fail to provide steps 2-6 (cd my_app, edit lib/main.dart, add dependencies, flutter pub get, flutter test). The agent's focus on meta-commentary about missing facts rather than attempting to answer based on available information demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the task. For L4 questions, the agent must provide the procedural steps, not analyze the completeness of their knowledge base."

However, this is the standard Flutter command for adding packages. After adding the http package, you could verify your setup and run the app using `flutter run` (as mentioned in Fact #12).\n\n**Additional context**: The facts provided also include extensive information about the 2026 Winter Olympics, which is not relevant to your Flutter development question.",

      "reasoning": "The agent correctly provides steps 1 and 2 (flutter create weather_app, cd weather_app) and understands the concept of adding dependencies. However, there's a significant difference in step 3: the agent suggests 'flutter pub add http' as the primary method, while the expected answer requires manually editing pubspec.yaml to add 'http: ^1.0.0' followed by 'flutter pub get'. The agent does mention the manual method as an alternative, but presents it as secondary when the expected answer treats it as the primary approach. The core procedural knowledge is partially correct, but the specific sequence and emphasis differs from what was expected for this L4 procedural learning question."
