      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies February 21, 2026 as the end date of the 2026 Winter Olympics, which matches the expected answer perfectly. The additional context provided (sources, location, corroboration from multiple facts) demonstrates thorough reasoning but does not detract from the accuracy of the core answer. For an L1 recall question, the factual accuracy is perfect."
