      "reasoning": "Perfect answer. The agent correctly calculated 8 medals (26 - 18) for the L3 temporal reasoning task. The response shows clear step-by-step work, proper chronological organization, accurate arithmetic, verification of the calculation, and even provides helpful additional context about the gold medal breakdown. The answer directly matches the expected result and demonstrates thorough understanding of the temporal reasoning required."

      "score": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's main answer states 'Italy improved their gold medal count the most' which directly contradicts the calculations shown in their own work and the expected answer. The agent correctly calculated that Norway gained +5 golds, Italy +4, and US +2, but then incorrectly concluded Italy was the answer. The agent even states in their conclusion that 'Norway improved their gold medal count the most' which contradicts their opening answer. This is a critical error where the final answer is factually wrong despite correct intermediate work."

      "reasoning": "The agent correctly identifies Italy had 8 golds on Day 9 and 9 golds on Day 10 (+1 increase), but critically fails the L3 temporal reasoning task by not identifying Italy's Day 7 count or the complete trend. The expected answer shows Italy had +3 golds from Day 7-9 and +1 from Day 9-10 (total +4 golds with acceleration pattern). The agent claims this data is missing when it should have been available in the facts. The agent only captures 1 of 3 time intervals and misses the key 'acceleration' trend insight entirely."
