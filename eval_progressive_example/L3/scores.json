      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is perfect. It correctly identifies the medal counts at Day 7 (18 medals) and Day 9 (26 medals), performs the correct calculation (26 - 18 = 8), and arrives at the expected answer of 8 medals. The response demonstrates excellent temporal reasoning (L3) by organizing facts chronologically, showing the calculation clearly, providing verification through multiple methods, and explaining the time period covered. The answer is well-structured, accurate, and matches the expected answer exactly."

      "reasoning": "The agent's answer is correct and comprehensive. They systematically identified all relevant countries, accurately calculated the gold medal improvements (Norway +5, Italy +4, US +2, Germany +2), verified their calculations, and correctly concluded that Norway had the largest improvement with +5 golds. While the expected answer mentions 'Norway +5 total' (which appears to be noting total medals vs. just golds), the question specifically asks about gold medal count improvement, which the agent answered correctly. The agent's methodology is clear, accurate, and leads to the right conclusion."

The country gained 3 gold medals between Day 7 and Day 9, then added 1 more gold medal by Day 10. This represents an 80% increase in their gold medal count over this period (from 5 to 9 medals). The rate of gold medal acquisition was faster in the first period (+3 medals over 2 days) compared to the second period (+1 medal over 1 day).",
      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer perfectly captures the expected trend. It correctly identifies the +3 golds from Day 7-9, the +1 gold from Day 9-10, and the total of +4 golds. The agent goes beyond the expected answer by providing additional context (dates, percentage increase, rate comparison) without introducing any inaccuracies. The characterization of 'consistent growth' with 'faster rate in the first period' is semantically equivalent to 'acceleration' in the expected answer, as both describe the slowing rate of gain. This is a complete and accurate L3 temporal reasoning response."
