      STEP 1: DEFINE CASCADE LEVELS

      Operation: {{operation}}
      Timeout Strategy: {{timeout_strategy}}
      Fallback Type: {{fallback_type}}

      Define the three cascade levels:

      PRIMARY (Optimal):
      - Best possible outcome
      - May depend on external services
      - Can fail or timeout

      SECONDARY (Acceptable):
      - Reduced quality but functional
      - More reliable than primary
      - Acceptable for users

      TERTIARY (Guaranteed):
      - ALWAYS succeeds, NEVER fails
      - No external dependencies
      - Minimal but functional

      Timeout values based on strategy:
      - aggressive: 5s / 2s / 1s
      - balanced: 30s / 10s / 5s
      - patient: 120s / 30s / 10s

      CRITICAL: Ensure tertiary ALWAYS succeeds.

      Output cascade level definitions with timeouts.
    output: "cascade_levels"

      STEP 2: PRIMARY ATTEMPT

      Cascade Levels: {{cascade_levels}}
      Operation: {{operation}}

      Execute the PRIMARY approach:
      1. Attempt optimal solution
      2. Monitor for timeout
      3. Track success/failure

      If PRIMARY succeeds:
      - Report SUCCESS at PRIMARY level
      - Skip to Step 5 (reporting)

      If PRIMARY fails or times out:
      - Report failure reason
      - Proceed to SECONDARY
    output: "primary_result"
    on_error: continue

  - id: "step-3-secondary"
    agent: "foundation:modular-builder"
    prompt: |
      STEP 3: SECONDARY FALLBACK

      Cascade Levels: {{cascade_levels}}
      Primary Result: {{primary_result}}

      Execute SECONDARY approach (acceptable degradation):
      1. Use fallback approach
      2. Accept reduced quality/freshness/completeness
      3. Track what degraded

      If SECONDARY succeeds:
      - Report SUCCESS at SECONDARY level
      - Document what degraded
      - Skip to Step 5

      If SECONDARY fails:
      - Report failure reason
      - Proceed to TERTIARY
    output: "secondary_result"
    on_error: continue

  - id: "step-4-tertiary"
    agent: "foundation:modular-builder"

      STEP 4: TERTIARY GUARANTEE

      Cascade Levels: {{cascade_levels}}
      Secondary Result: {{secondary_result}}

      Execute TERTIARY approach (guaranteed completion):
      1. Use simplest possible approach
      2. No external dependencies
      3. MUST succeed

      CRITICAL: This level CANNOT fail.
      - Use cached data if needed
      - Use static defaults if needed
      - Return minimal but functional result

      Report SUCCESS at TERTIARY level with degradation details.
    output: "tertiary_result"

  - id: "step-5-report"
    agent: "foundation:zen-architect"
    prompt: |
      STEP 5: DEGRADATION REPORTING

      Primary: {{primary_result}}
      Secondary: {{secondary_result}}
      Tertiary: {{tertiary_result}}
      Notification Level: {{notification}}

      Report degradation to user based on notification level:

      - silent: Log only, no user notification
      - warning: Inform user of degradation
      - explicit: Detailed explanation of what degraded and why

      Output user-appropriate degradation report.
    output: "degradation_report"

  - id: "step-6-metrics"
    type: bash
    command: |
      echo "=== Cascade Metrics ==="
      echo "Operation: {{operation}}"
      echo "Timeout Strategy: {{timeout_strategy}}"
      echo "Fallback Type: {{fallback_type}}"
      echo "Metrics logged for optimization analysis"

  - id: "step-7-optimize"
    agent: "foundation:zen-architect"
    prompt: |
      STEP 7: CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION

      Degradation Report: {{degradation_report}}
      Cascade Levels: {{cascade_levels}}

      Analyze cascade performance for optimization:

      1. Was timeout appropriate?
      2. Could PRIMARY succeed with more time?
      3. Is SECONDARY too aggressive?
      4. Are there patterns in failures?
      5. Should cascade levels be adjusted?

      Output recommendations for future cascade optimization.
    output: "optimization_recommendations"
