      PHASE 1: SCOPE DEFINITION

      Investigation Topic: {{investigation_topic}}

      Define investigation boundaries and success criteria BEFORE any exploration.

      Tasks:
      1. Identify explicit user requirements - What specific questions must be answered?
      2. Clarify investigation scope
      3. Define what counts as "understanding achieved"
      4. List specific questions that must be answered
      5. Identify known unknowns
      6. Set boundaries: in-scope vs out-of-scope
      7. Estimate investigation depth needed

      Deliverables:
      - Investigation scope document with:
        - Core questions to answer
        - Success criteria
        - Scope boundaries
        - Estimated depth and timeline
    output: "scope_document"

  - id: "phase-2-strategy"
    agent: "foundation:zen-architect"

      PHASE 2: EXPLORATION STRATEGY

      Scope: {{scope_document}}

      Plan which agents to deploy and what to investigate.

      Tasks:
      1. Design exploration strategy
      2. Check for similar past investigations
      3. Identify key areas to explore (code paths, configs, docs)
      4. Select specialized agents for Phase 3
      5. Create investigation roadmap with priorities
      6. Identify potential dead ends to avoid
      7. Plan verification approach

      Agent Selection:
      - Code understanding: analyzer, patterns
      - System architecture: architect, api-designer
      - Performance issues: optimizer, analyzer
      - Security concerns: security, patterns
      - Integration flows: integration, database

      Deliverables:
      - Exploration strategy document with:
        - Investigation roadmap
        - Agent deployment plan
        - Priority order
    output: "strategy_document"

  - id: "phase-3-deep-dives"
    agent: "foundation:explorer"
    prompt: |
      PHASE 3: PARALLEL DEEP DIVES

      Strategy: {{strategy_document}}
      Scope: {{scope_document}}

      Execute the exploration strategy with parallel investigations.

      For each priority area:
      1. Deploy appropriate agent
      2. Document findings immediately
      3. Note unexpected discoveries
      4. Track remaining questions
      5. Flag areas needing deeper investigation

      Follow the diamond pattern:
      - Expand broadly first (collect all relevant information)
      - Then synthesize findings (extract patterns and insights)

      Output comprehensive findings from all investigation areas.
    output: "findings"

  - id: "phase-4-verification"
    agent: "foundation:zen-architect"
    prompt: |
      PHASE 4: VERIFICATION

      Findings: {{findings}}
      Original Questions: {{scope_document}}

      Test understanding through practical application.

      Verification methods:
      1. Can explain the system flow to someone else
      2. Can predict behavior in new scenarios
      3. Can identify where changes would need to be made
      4. Can trace data flow through the system
      5. Can answer the original investigation questions

      Output:
      - Verification results
      - Remaining gaps in understanding
      - Confidence level in findings
    output: "verification_results"

  - id: "phase-5-synthesis"
    agent: "foundation:zen-architect"
    prompt: |
      PHASE 5: SYNTHESIS

      Findings: {{findings}}
      Verification: {{verification_results}}
      Original Scope: {{scope_document}}

      Combine all findings into coherent understanding.

      Tasks:
      1. Synthesize insights across all exploration areas
      2. Create conceptual models or diagrams
      3. Identify patterns and principles
      4. Document trade-offs discovered
      5. Formulate recommendations

      Output comprehensive synthesis of all learnings.
    output: "synthesis"

  - id: "phase-6-capture"
    agent: "foundation:zen-architect"
    prompt: |
      PHASE 6: KNOWLEDGE CAPTURE

      Synthesis: {{synthesis}}
      Findings: {{findings}}
      Scope: {{scope_document}}

      Document learnings for future reference.

      Create {{output_format}} entry with:
      1. Investigation summary
      2. Key findings and insights
      3. Architectural diagrams (Mermaid)
      4. Code examples where relevant
      5. Recommendations for future work
      6. Related areas for further investigation

      Format for easy future retrieval and reuse.
    output: "knowledge_document"
