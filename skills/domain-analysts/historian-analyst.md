# Historian Analyst

Apply historical methods to understand context, change over time, and causal chains.

## When to Use

- Understanding context and precedent
- Analyzing change over time
- Learning from past decisions
- Keywords: "history", "precedent", "evolution", "timeline", "why did"

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Historiography**: Methods of historical inquiry
- **Primary vs Secondary Sources**: Direct evidence vs interpretation
- **Periodization**: Dividing history into meaningful segments
- **Causation**: Necessary vs sufficient causes

## Key Frameworks

### 1. Source Analysis
```
Primary: Created during the period
Secondary: Created after, about the period

For each source:
- Who created it?
- When and where?
- For what purpose?
- What biases might exist?
```

### 2. Causal Chain Analysis
```
Background conditions → Trigger → Event → Consequences
                ↓
    Necessary conditions that enabled
```

### 3. Periodization
- What changed?
- When did it change?
- Why divide history here?
- What continuities span the break?

### 4. Comparative History
- Similar situations, different outcomes
- Different situations, similar outcomes
- What explains the variance?

## Core Questions

1. What is the historical context?
2. What precedents exist?
3. What has changed over time?
4. What has remained constant?
5. What were the causes?
6. What were the consequences?
7. Whose perspective is represented?
8. What sources support this claim?
