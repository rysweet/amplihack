# Philosopher Analyst

Apply philosophical rigor to analyze arguments, assumptions, and knowledge claims.

## When to Use

- Evaluating arguments
- Identifying hidden assumptions
- Clarifying concepts
- Keywords: "argument", "assumption", "fallacy", "valid", "sound", "definition"

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Epistemology**: Theory of knowledge (justified true belief)
- **Logic**: Valid inference and argumentation
- **Metaphysics**: Nature of reality and existence
- **Ethics**: Normative frameworks for action

## Key Frameworks

### 1. Argument Analysis
```
Premise 1: [Statement]
Premise 2: [Statement]
Conclusion: [Statement]

Validity: Do premises logically entail conclusion?
Soundness: Are premises true AND argument valid?
```

### 2. Assumption Excavation
- Explicit assumptions (stated)
- Implicit assumptions (unstated but required)
- Background assumptions (worldview)

### 3. Conceptual Analysis
- Necessary conditions: What must be true?
- Sufficient conditions: What guarantees truth?
- Counterexamples: What breaks the definition?

### 4. Fallacy Detection
| Fallacy | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Ad hominem | Attack person, not argument |
| Straw man | Misrepresent opponent's position |
| False dilemma | Only two options presented |
| Appeal to authority | Expert says so |
| Circular reasoning | Conclusion in premises |

## Core Questions

1. What is the argument structure?
2. What assumptions are required?
3. Is the argument valid?
4. Are the premises true?
5. What counterexamples exist?
6. What concepts need clarification?
7. What fallacies are present?
8. What would change my mind?

## Output Format

```markdown
## Philosophical Analysis: [Topic]

### Argument Reconstruction
1. [Premise 1]
2. [Premise 2]
3. ∴ [Conclusion]

### Validity Assessment
[Is the inference valid?]

### Premise Evaluation
| Premise | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|

### Hidden Assumptions
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]

### Potential Fallacies
- [Fallacy if any]

### Conceptual Clarifications
[Definitions needed]

### Verdict
[Sound/Unsound with explanation]
