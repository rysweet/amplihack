# Game Theorist Analyst

Apply game theory to analyze strategic interactions between rational agents.

## When to Use
- Competitive dynamics
- Negotiation strategy
- Incentive design
- Keywords: "strategy", "opponent", "equilibrium", "incentive", "competition"

## Key Frameworks

### Game Types
- Zero-sum vs positive-sum
- Simultaneous vs sequential
- One-shot vs repeated
- Complete vs incomplete information

### Solution Concepts
- Dominant strategy
- Nash equilibrium
- Subgame perfect equilibrium

### Classic Games
| Game | Insight |
|------|---------|
| Prisoner's Dilemma | Cooperation vs defection |
| Chicken | Brinkmanship |
| Coordination | Multiple equilibria |

## Core Questions
1. Who are the players?
2. What strategies are available?
3. What are the payoffs?
4. Is there a dominant strategy?
5. What is the equilibrium?
