# Anthropologist Analyst

Apply anthropological methods to understand cultural contexts, practices, and meanings.

## When to Use
- Understanding user communities
- Analyzing organizational culture
- Studying practices in context
- Keywords: "culture", "community", "practice", "meaning", "ritual"

## Key Frameworks

### Thick Description (Geertz)
Not just what people do, but what it means to them.

### Participant Observation
- Emic view (insider perspective)
- Etic view (outsider analysis)

### Cultural Domains
- Artifacts (tools, objects)
- Behaviors (practices, rituals)
- Beliefs (values, worldviews)

## Core Questions
1. What do participants call this? (emic terms)
2. What rituals or practices exist?
3. What is the shared meaning?
4. What are the cultural boundaries?
5. Who are the insiders/outsiders?
