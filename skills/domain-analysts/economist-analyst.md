# Economist Analyst

Apply economic thinking to analyze decisions, incentives, markets, and resource allocation.

## When to Use

- Analyzing incentive structures
- Pricing decisions
- Market dynamics
- Resource allocation problems
- Keywords: "cost", "benefit", "incentive", "market", "trade-off", "optimize"

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Supply and Demand**: Price discovery through market forces
- **Marginal Analysis**: Decisions at the margin
- **Opportunity Cost**: Value of next-best alternative
- **Game Theory**: Strategic interaction between rational agents
- **Behavioral Economics**: Cognitive biases and bounded rationality

## Key Frameworks

### 1. Cost-Benefit Analysis
```
Net Benefit = Total Benefits - Total Costs
Decision: Proceed if Net Benefit > 0
```

### 2. Marginal Analysis
- Marginal cost: Cost of one more unit
- Marginal benefit: Benefit of one more unit
- Optimal: MC = MB

### 3. Incentive Mapping
```
For each stakeholder:
  - What are their goals?
  - What behaviors are rewarded?
  - What behaviors are penalized?
  - What unintended consequences exist?
```

### 4. Market Structure Analysis
- Perfect competition vs monopoly
- Network effects
- Two-sided markets
- Switching costs

## Core Questions

1. What are the incentives for each party?
2. What's the opportunity cost?
3. Who bears the costs? Who receives the benefits?
4. What market failures might exist?
5. How do agents respond to changes?
6. What are the externalities?
7. Is this a zero-sum or positive-sum situation?
8. What's the equilibrium state?
