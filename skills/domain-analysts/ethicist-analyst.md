# Ethicist Analyst

Apply ethical frameworks to evaluate decisions and actions.

## When to Use
- Moral dilemmas
- Policy decisions
- Technology ethics
- Keywords: "should", "right", "wrong", "ethical", "moral"

## Key Frameworks

### Consequentialism
- Outcomes determine rightness
- Greatest good for greatest number
- Cost-benefit of harms/benefits

### Deontology
- Rules and duties matter
- Some actions inherently wrong
- Categorical imperatives

### Virtue Ethics
- Character of the actor
- What would a virtuous person do?
- Cultivating good habits

## Core Questions
1. Who is affected?
2. What are the potential harms?
3. What duties or rights are involved?
4. What would a virtuous person do?
5. What precedent does this set?
