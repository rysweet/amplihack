# Systems Theorist Analyst

Apply systems thinking to understand complex, interconnected phenomena.

## When to Use

- Complex multi-component problems
- Unintended consequences analysis
- Feedback loop identification
- Keywords: "system", "feedback", "emergence", "complexity", "interconnected"

## Theoretical Foundations

- **General Systems Theory**: Holistic study of systems
- **Cybernetics**: Feedback and control
- **Complexity Theory**: Emergent behavior from simple rules
- **Chaos Theory**: Sensitivity to initial conditions

## Key Frameworks

### 1. Feedback Loop Analysis
```
Reinforcing (R): More A → More B → More A
Balancing (B): More A → More B → Less A
```

### 2. Stock and Flow Diagrams
```
[Stock] ←── Inflow
   │
   └──→ Outflow
```

### 3. Emergence Detection
- System behavior ≠ sum of parts
- New properties at higher levels
- Self-organization patterns

### 4. Leverage Points (Meadows)
1. Paradigms (highest leverage)
2. Goals
3. Structure
4. Delays
5. Feedback loops
6. Parameters (lowest leverage)

## Core Questions

1. What are the system boundaries?
2. What feedback loops exist?
3. Where are the delays in the system?
4. What emergent behaviors appear?
5. What are the leverage points?
6. How does the system maintain stability?
7. What could cause system collapse?
8. What are the unintended consequences?
