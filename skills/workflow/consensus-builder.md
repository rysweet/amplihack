# Consensus Builder

Multi-perspective consensus building for synthesizing diverse viewpoints into aligned outcomes.

## When to Use

- Team decisions with different opinions
- Resolving conflicting requirements
- Stakeholder alignment
- Architectural debates
- Keywords: "disagree", "different views", "align", "consensus", "conflicting"

## Core Concept

Systematically collect positions, identify common ground, surface and address disagreements, then build synthesis that stakeholders can commit to.

## Consensus Levels

| Level | Definition | When Appropriate |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| **Full Consensus** | Everyone agrees | Rare, don't force |
| **Consent** | No one blocks | Most decisions |
| **Majority** | Most agree | When consent fails |
| **Consultative** | Input heard, one decides | Time-critical |
| **Directive** | One decides, informs | Emergency |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Collect Positions

```markdown
## Position Collection

**Topic:** [What we're deciding]

### Position 1: [Stakeholder/Perspective A]
**Stance:** [Their position]
**Rationale:** [Why they hold this view]
**Key Concerns:** [What worries them]
**Must-Haves:** [Non-negotiable requirements]
**Nice-to-Haves:** [Preferred but flexible]

### Position 2: [Stakeholder/Perspective B]
**Stance:** [...]
**Rationale:** [...]
**Key Concerns:** [...]
**Must-Haves:** [...]
**Nice-to-Haves:** [...]

### Position 3: [Stakeholder/Perspective C]
[...]
```

### Step 2: Identify Common Ground

```markdown
## Common Ground Analysis

### Shared Goals
All parties agree on:
- [Shared goal 1]
- [Shared goal 2]

### Shared Concerns
All parties worried about:
- [Shared concern 1]
- [Shared concern 2]

### Shared Constraints
All parties accept:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

### Compatible Must-Haves
These requirements don't conflict:
| From | Requirement | Compatible With |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| A | [Req] | B, C |
| B | [Req] | A, C |
```

### Step 3: Surface Disagreements

```markdown
## Disagreement Map

### Disagreement 1: [Topic]
| Position | Held By | Strength |
|----------|---------|----------|
| [View A] | [Who] | [Strong/Moderate/Flexible] |
| [View B] | [Who] | [Strong/Moderate/Flexible] |

**Root Cause:** [Why they disagree]
- Different values?
- Different information?
- Different risk tolerance?
- Different time horizons?

**Stakes:** [What happens if unresolved]

### Disagreement 2: [Topic]
[...]
```

### Step 4: Resolve Disagreements

```markdown
## Disagreement Resolution

### Disagreement 1: [Topic]

**Resolution Strategy:** [Selected approach]

| Strategy | Description | Applicable? |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Information | Share missing info | [Yes/No] |
| Reframe | Find larger shared goal | [Yes/No] |
| Trade | Exchange concessions | [Yes/No] |
| Sequence | Do both over time | [Yes/No] |
| Experiment | Test and learn | [Yes/No] |
| Escalate | Higher authority decides | [Last resort] |

**Resolution:**
[How disagreement was resolved]

**Concessions:**
- [Party A] gives up: [What]
- [Party B] gives up: [What]

**Remaining Concerns:**
- [Addressed how]
```

### Step 5: Build Synthesis

```markdown
## Synthesis

### Proposed Resolution
[Description of the synthesized position]

### How It Addresses Each Position

| Position | Addressed How | Satisfaction |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| A | [How their concerns met] | [High/Medium/Low] |
| B | [How their concerns met] | [High/Medium/Low] |
| C | [How their concerns met] | [High/Medium/Low] |

### Trade-offs Made
- [Trade-off 1]: [Who gains] / [Who gives]
- [Trade-off 2]: [...]

### Commitments Required
| From | Commitment |
|------|------------|
| A | [What they commit to] |
| B | [What they commit to] |
| C | [What they commit to] |
```

### Step 6: Establish Confidence Levels

```markdown
## Confidence Assessment

### Consensus Type Achieved
[Full/Consent/Majority/Consultative]

### Confidence by Stakeholder
| Stakeholder | Confidence | Concerns Remaining |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| A | [High/Med/Low] | [What if any] |
| B | [High/Med/Low] | [What if any] |
| C | [High/Med/Low] | [What if any] |

### Overall Confidence
**Level:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Basis:** [Why this level]

### Risk of Breakdown
**Likelihood:** [Low/Medium/High]
**Triggers:** [What could unravel consensus]
**Mitigation:** [How to prevent]
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Consensus Report: [Topic]

### Summary
**Decision:** [One-line outcome]
**Consensus Type:** [Full/Consent/Majority]
**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]

### Positions Represented
1. [Position A] - [Key concern]
2. [Position B] - [Key concern]
3. [Position C] - [Key concern]

### Common Ground
- [Shared element 1]
- [Shared element 2]

### Disagreements Resolved
| Disagreement | Resolution | Concessions |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| [Topic] | [How resolved] | [What given up] |

### Final Synthesis
[The consensus position]

### Commitments
| Party | Commits To |
|-------|------------|
| A | [Commitment] |
| B | [Commitment] |

### Remaining Tensions
- [Tension]: [Monitoring plan]

### Review Trigger
[When to revisit this consensus]
```

## Resolution Strategies Detail

### Information Resolution
Disagreement stems from different facts.
*Action:* Share information, align understanding.

### Reframe Resolution
Disagreement dissolves at higher level.
*Action:* Find shared goal that contains both positions.

### Trade Resolution
Both sides have valid needs.
*Action:* Exchange: "I'll give you X if you give me Y."

### Sequence Resolution
Both are right for different times.
*Action:* Phase the approach: A first, then B.

### Experiment Resolution
Uncertainty about which is better.
*Action:* Try small, measure, then commit.

### Escalate Resolution
Fundamental conflict, can't resolve locally.
*Action:* Bring to authority with clear framing.

## Consensus Quality Indicators

| Indicator | Healthy | Unhealthy |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Participation** | All voices heard | Some silent |
| **Honesty** | Real concerns raised | Polite agreement |
| **Flexibility** | Positions evolved | Entrenched |
| **Ownership** | Shared commitment | Blame preparation |
| **Clarity** | Clear next steps | Ambiguous |

## Anti-Patterns

- Forced consensus (suppressing disagreement)
- False consensus (agreement without understanding)
- Premature consensus (not fully exploring positions)
- Consensus theater (going through motions)
- Unanimity requirement (blocking progress)
- Ignoring minority positions (setting up sabotage)
- Vague consensus (everyone interprets differently)
