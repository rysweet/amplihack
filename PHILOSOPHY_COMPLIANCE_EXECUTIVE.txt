================================================================================
ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

1. CLEAR SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
   - SessionStartDetector: Knows when to classify
   - WorkflowClassifier: Knows which workflow
   - ExecutionTierCascade: Knows how to execute
   - SessionStartClassifierSkill: Coordinates the three

2. ZERO DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN BRICKS
   - Each module is self-contained
   - Dependencies are explicit and injected
   - No circular dependencies
   - No hidden coupling

3. TRANSPARENT CONFIGURATION
   - Keyword lists are explicit (not magic)
   - Tier priority is configurable
   - Environment variables are documented
   - All public APIs are clear

4. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION
   - Tier 3 (markdown) always works
   - System never fails completely
   - Fallback reasons are logged
   - Errors are honest and clear

5. EXCELLENT TESTING STRATEGY
   - 60% unit tests (classification logic)
   - 20% integration tests (component interaction)
   - 20% acceptance tests (workflows)
   - Proportional to implementation complexity

================================================================================
PHILOSOPHY ALIGNMENT EVIDENCE
================================================================================

RUTHLESS SIMPLICITY
  - Keyword matching is simple substring search (no ML)
  - Three-line decision logic for session start detection
  - Straightforward 4-way classification with priority order
  - No premature optimization or over-engineering

BRICK PHILOSOPHY
  - SessionStartDetector: One responsibility - detect trigger
  - WorkflowClassifier: One responsibility - route to workflow
  - ExecutionTierCascade: One responsibility - execute with fallback
  - SessionStartClassifierSkill: One responsibility - orchestrate
  - All bricks have clear public contracts (studs)

ZERO-BS IMPLEMENTATION
  - No stubs or placeholder functions
  - No TODO or FIXME comments
  - No dead code or unused imports
  - Every function is fully implemented and tested
  - Tier 3 is honest: "This always works, let Claude read markdown"

REGENERATABLE DESIGN
  - Specs are clear enough to rebuild from scratch
  - No hidden assumptions or implicit dependencies
  - All configuration is explicit
  - Public contracts are well-documented

================================================================================
CONCERNS (MINOR - ALL ACCEPTABLE)
================================================================================

1. KEYWORD MATCHING PRECISION
   Risk: "I understand how this works" matches "understand" keyword
   Status: ACCEPTABLE - Matches simplicity principle
   Reasoning: Fuzzy matching would add complexity far beyond value
              System gracefully degrades to DEFAULT_WORKFLOW if ambiguous

2. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE COUPLING
   Code: os.environ.get("AMPLIHACK_USE_RECIPES", "1")
   Status: ACCEPTABLE - Intentional design choice
   Reasoning: Allows runtime configuration without complex injection
              Variable usage is explicit and documented

3. LAZY IMPORT PATTERN
   Pattern: Imports deferred to when tier is actually executed
   Status: ACCEPTABLE - Correct graceful degradation
   Reasoning: Allows system to work even if recipe runner not installed
              Error messages are clear when imports fail

All three concerns are EXPECTED DESIGN DECISIONS, not violations.

================================================================================
CODE QUALITY OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

POSITIVE
  ✓ Clear, readable code that documents itself
  ✓ Comprehensive docstrings for all public methods
  ✓ Type hints on all function signatures
  ✓ Proper error messages that explain what went wrong
  ✓ Logging at appropriate points (info, warning, error)
  ✓ Configuration is flexible and extensible

ZERO-BS EXAMPLES
  ✓ No abstract base classes (not needed)
  ✓ No decorators or metaclasses (not needed)
  ✓ No inheritance hierarchies (not needed)
  ✓ No validation frameworks (not needed)
  ✓ No dependency injection containers (not needed)
  ✓ Simple classes doing simple things

================================================================================
REGENERATION ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Can an AI rebuild this module from a specification?

SPECIFICATION CLARITY:  Excellent
  - Each module has a clear, single responsibility
  - Input/output contracts are explicit
  - Logic flow is transparent
  - Keyword lists are not hidden

CONTRACT DEFINITION:    Well-Defined
  - Public methods are documented
  - Parameter types are explicit
  - Return values are clear
  - No hidden dependencies

VERDICT: YES - READY FOR AI REGENERATION

The entire system could be rebuilt from these high-level specifications:

  1. "SessionStartDetector: Detect when classification should trigger"
  2. "WorkflowClassifier: Route request to one of 4 workflows"
  3. "ExecutionTierCascade: Execute workflow via tier cascade"
  4. "SessionStartClassifierSkill: Orchestrate the three above"

No reverse-engineering would be needed. The spec would suffice.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE CHANGES: None required

The implementation is philosophy-compliant and production-ready.
No violations or critical issues detected.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Not blocking)

1. Keyword Management (when list grows beyond 50 keywords)
   - Move keyword lists to configuration file
   - Spec would remain the same; only storage changes
   - Current embedded list is fine for current use

2. Tier Detection (Already good, just noting)
   - tier_priority is already configurable
   - Good design choice for extensibility
