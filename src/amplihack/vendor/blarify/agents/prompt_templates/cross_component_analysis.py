You will receive three inputs:
1. System overview containing high-level system information
2. Analyzed nodes with detailed component analysis
3. Dependencies showing relationships between components

Your task is to analyze the cross-component patterns and system-wide interactions to identify:
- Common patterns across components
- System-wide architecture principles
- Integration patterns
- Data flow through the system
- Configuration and deployment patterns

Return your analysis as structured JSON that provides insights into how components work together and what architectural patterns emerge from their interactions.""",
