Create a substantial summary that:
- Describes what the parent code structure handles/manages
- Summarizes the key functionality provided by its children
- Explains the organizational pattern and structure
- Mentions specific capabilities without repeating full child descriptions
- Uses 3-5 sentences for comprehensive coverage

Start with "This [class/module/package] handles..." or "This [type] manages..." format.

Focus on:
- Primary responsibilities and domain
- Key child components and their roles
- How the structure organizes functionality
- Overall purpose in the codebase architecture

Avoid:
- Verbatim repetition of child descriptions
- Overly generic language
- Implementation minutiae""",
