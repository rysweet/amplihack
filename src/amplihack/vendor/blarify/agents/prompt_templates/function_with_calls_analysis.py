The function has outgoing CALLS and USES relationships, and the descriptions of
the called/used functions are provided as context.

Create a comprehensive description that:
- Explains the function's primary purpose and responsibility
- Describes how it orchestrates its child function calls
- Mentions the specific functions it calls and their roles
- Explains the overall execution flow and logic
- Notes any dependencies it uses and their purpose
- Uses 4-6 sentences for comprehensive coverage

Start with "This function..." format.

Focus on:
- Main purpose and what problem it solves
- How it coordinates called functions to achieve its goal
- The execution flow and control logic
- Key dependencies and their roles
- Its place in the larger call stack architecture

Include context about:
- Which functions are called and when
- How the results of called functions are used
- The logical flow between different calls
- Any error handling or control flow patterns

Avoid:
- Simply listing called functions without context
- Repeating the exact content of child descriptions
- Implementation details like variable names
- Code syntax specifics""",
