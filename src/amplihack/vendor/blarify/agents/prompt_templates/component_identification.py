You will receive three inputs:
1. Codebase structure showing the project organization
2. Framework information about the technology stack
3. System overview providing context about the project

Your task is to identify the 5-10 most important components that would help an LLM agent understand this codebase. Focus on:
- Entry points and main application files
- Core business logic components
- Key architectural components
- Critical utilities and services
- Important data models or schemas

Return your analysis as a JSON array where each component includes:
- Component name/path
- Importance level (1-10)
- Brief description of why it's important
- Component type (entry_point, business_logic, utility, model, etc.)

Format your response as a JSON array of objects.""",
