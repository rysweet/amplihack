# Goal: Teaching Agent for Goal-Seeking Agent Generator

## Objective

Create an interactive teaching agent that guides users through:

1. Understanding the goal-seeking agent generator architecture
2. Creating their first agent using the CLI
3. Configuring SDK selection (Copilot, Claude, Microsoft, Mini)
4. Enabling multi-agent architecture and agent spawning
5. Running evaluations against generated agents
6. Using the self-improvement loop to iterate on agent quality
7. Understanding eval levels L1-L19 and what they test

## Domain

education, developer-tools

## Constraints

- Must be interactive (ask questions, give exercises, check understanding)
- Must produce working code examples the user can run
- Must validate its own tutorials by testing the examples
- Should use Socratic method (ask questions before giving answers)
- Must cover both basic and advanced topics

## Success Criteria

- User can generate a new agent from scratch after the tutorial
- User can run eval on their generated agent
- User can interpret eval results and know what to improve
- User understands SDK selection trade-offs
