## Answer Synthesis Template

When synthesizing an answer from stored knowledge:

### Structure

1. **Direct Answer** - Lead with the most relevant response
2. **Supporting Evidence** - List facts from memory that support the answer
3. **Confidence Assessment** - Rate overall confidence (high/medium/low)
4. **Knowledge Gaps** - Note any areas where knowledge is incomplete
5. **Recommendations** - Suggest follow-up learning if appropriate

### Synthesis by Question Level

- **L1 (Simple Recall)**: Direct fact retrieval, high confidence expected
- **L2 (Multi-Source)**: Combine facts from multiple memory searches
- **L3 (Temporal)**: Consider time-based ordering and recency of facts
- **L4 (Inferential)**: Draw logical conclusions from stored facts
- **L5 (Teaching)**: Explain concepts at appropriate depth for the audience
- **L6 (Incremental)**: Build on previous knowledge, note what changed

### Quality Checks

- Are all claims backed by stored facts?
- Did you search memory before making claims?
- Are confidence levels appropriate?
- Did you identify what you DON'T know?
- Is the response structured and clear?
