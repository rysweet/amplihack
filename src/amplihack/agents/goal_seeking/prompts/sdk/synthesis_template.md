## Answer Synthesis Template

When synthesizing an answer from stored knowledge:

### Response Structure
1. **Direct Answer**: State the answer clearly and concisely
2. **Supporting Evidence**: List the stored facts that support this answer
3. **Confidence Assessment**: Rate overall confidence (high/medium/low)
4. **Knowledge Gaps**: Note what is unknown or uncertain
5. **Recommendations**: Suggest what to learn next

### Complexity Levels
- **L1 (Simple Recall)**: Direct fact retrieval, single source
- **L2 (Multi-Source)**: Combine facts from multiple contexts
- **L3 (Temporal)**: Consider time-based relationships
- **L4 (Inference)**: Draw conclusions from related facts
- **L5 (Comparison)**: Compare and contrast stored knowledge
- **L6 (Integration)**: Synthesize across domains

### Quality Standards
- Never fabricate facts not in memory
- Clearly distinguish between stored facts and inferences
- Quantify uncertainty when possible
- Provide actionable next steps for filling gaps
