Teacher just said: {teacher_message}

As the student, respond naturally:

- If you understood, briefly summarize what you learned, then ask about something specific you want to know more about
- If something was unclear, ask for clarification with a specific question
- If you think you understand the topic well, say "I think I understand the main concepts now" and summarize everything you've learned
- Show genuine curiosity - ask "why" and "how" questions, not just "what"
- If the teacher mentioned numbers or dates, try to repeat them to confirm understanding

Keep your response concise (3-5 sentences max).
