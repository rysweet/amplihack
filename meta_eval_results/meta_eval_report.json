      "student_answer": "```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"L1 (Recall) tests direct fact retrieval from a single article - the simplest level asking the agent to remember explicit information like 'According to the article, what is mentioned about Tesla's new factory?' L2 (Inference) tests reasoning ability and understanding of cause-and-effect relationships within an article, identified by keywords like 'because', 'due to', 'resulted in', 'led to'. L3 (Synthesis) requires combining information from at least 2 different sources to identify relationships, patterns, or common themes across articles. L4 (Application) is the most challenging level, testing whether the agent can apply learned knowledge to new, hypothetical scenarios that weren't covered in the articles, requiring generalization beyond specific facts.\",\n  \"self_explanation\": \"I learned that the four levels form a progression of cognitive difficulty. L1 and L2 work with single articles (recall and causality), while L3 requires cross-referencing multiple sources. L4 goes beyond what was explicitly stated to test true comprehension through application to novel situations. The teacher explained this as: L1 = remember, L2 = understand causality, L3 = connect sources, L4 = apply to new situations. This hierarchy tests increasingly sophisticated cognitive abilities from basic memory to genuine understanding and extrapolation.\"\n}\n```",

Claude compares the meaning of the agent's answer against the correct answer and assigns a score from 0.0 to 1.0. A score of 0.8 means the agent captured the main points correctly but has minor gaps or omissions in the answer.\",\n  \"self_explanation\": \"During the teaching session, I learned that the grading system uses Claude as a semantic evaluator to score answers on a 0.0-1.0 scale. The teacher specifically explained the scoring ranges: 1.0 means semantically equivalent, 0.8-0.9 means the agent got the main points with minor gaps, 0.6-0.7 shows partial correctness with significant gaps, and below 0.5 indicates significant problems. So a score of 0.8 falls in the range where the agent understood and conveyed the core information correctly but missed some minor details.\"\n}\n```",

The teacher explicitly listed these 5 steps with the harness runner orchestrating them in sequence. The teacher emphasized that steps 3 and 4 use separate subprocesses for memory isolation, which is a key design feature to ensure the agent truly recalls from memory rather than accessing the articles during testing.\"\n}\n```",

This prevents the agent from 'cheating' by accessing the original articles or any variables from the learning phase during testing. The subprocess separation creates memory barriers that force the agent to genuinely retrieve information from its memory system rather than simply looking up data that's still in scope. This makes it a true test of the agent's retention and recall capabilities.\",\n  \"self_explanation\": \"This was explicitly taught multiple times throughout the teaching session. The teacher emphasized that subprocess isolation is a 'key design feature' and 'critical architectural detail' that ensures the agent must 'truly remember' and 'truly recall' rather than access articles during testing. The separate subprocesses create a 'clean-room test of retention' by establishing memory barriers between learning and testing phases.\"\n}\n```",

The teacher explicitly stated that 'The news-file must be JSON with a sources array' and that 'Each source needs: url, title, content, published fields.' The teacher also mentioned that 'Missing fields trigger a ValueError from the multi-source collector,' which confirms these four fields are mandatory. This was covered both in the 'Complete Evaluation Pipeline' section where it mentioned 'Ingests news from WebSearch JSON (validates required fields: url, title, content, published)' and again in the 'Running the Evaluation' section.\"\n}\n```",
